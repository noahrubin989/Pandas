    "* This video will investigate how we can manipulate a pandas series object in a sophisticated manner using `replace()`, `apply()` and `map()`\n",
    "* In doing so, we will introduce [lambda functions](https://towardsdatascience.com/lambda-functions-with-practical-examples-in-python-45934f3653a8), a useful python concept that works really nicely here\n",
    "* Data can be messy, so hopefully this video helps in cases where you come accross a dataset where one or more series' needs to be changed/cleaned in some sort of way\n",
    "* The table below shows where each function can be used\n",
