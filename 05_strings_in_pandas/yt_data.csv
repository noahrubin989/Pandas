Appearing on ABC’s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the “conduct described” in the allegations” should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.” She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside “if the allegations are true.”\nConway went on to state that the president isn’t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\n“I will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,” Conway said. “So he made a statement, he’s sticking by that statement.”\nShe continued, “He’s not being briefed on this bit by bit. He’s very focused on trade agreements. He’s very focused on global cooperation on a ........”\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesn’t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn’t always be prosecuting people through the press."

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?"

She says this battery issue is more troubling than a simpler assembly line problem, and points out that the head of Tesla's director of battery engineering left to start his own company, which is interesting timing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

So sorry! I️t will be back up and running soon! \n\nAs some of you may know, I lost my dad to kidney cancer almost 5 years ago. It has been a traumatic and grief filled world for me for so many reasons. Simply put, he was my dad. He was the main man in my life for almost all of my life and really ruled at it. I miss him every single day. More recently, really since Sonny was born, I find myself missing him more and more. It’s unfortunate how such amazing times in ones life, like getting married or having a baby, can be colored with such darkness. Again, I hate to be a total downer, but this is the reality of so many of our lives. This doesn’t mean we love our husbands or our babies or even our whole lives any less, it’s just that it’s difficult to fully feel pure happiness at these momentous occasions. Sometimes I’m ridden with the simple thought of how much better life would be with my dad and that just makes me so sad. Once I  get to that dark place though, my mind has the ability to take a turn and see not only how lucky I am for what I have, but how lucky I was to have a parent that taught me how to be a good parent in return. In this Chapter of I Love My Baby, But I Miss My Dad, we cover missing my dad, honoring my dad and passing on the lessons he taught me so his legacy lives on and on and on. He deserves that. I’d love to know how any of you out there who have lost parents have taught your children about them and kept the spirit of them alive. Comment below. Love you all.\n\nMusic Used: \nAvocado Street\nGymnopedie No1\nReflection Pool\nLife in Romance\nSimple Story"

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/"

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

"Who Matt Reeves Wants As Batman, Is Basmati Blues Culturally Insensitive? The John Campe Show",John Campea,24.0,39504.0,1389.0,92.0,696.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y2-JjnW3w2g/default.jpg,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Thursday, November 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nShahrukh Ali - My question is how can the studios release films that have seemingly incomplete or poor CGI ? Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it’s always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?"

Elon Musk Gives First Look At Tesla's Electric Semi,Tech Insider,2.0,741859.0,8604.0,599.0,2847.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fQvGSkTYJSE/default.jpg,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised the company's first electric semi-truck would be mind-blowing, and he delivered. \n\nMusk took the wraps off the big rig on Thursday at Tesla's Design Studio in Hawthorne, California, and the vehicle's design was definitely what got the most attention. \n\nThe semi can go 0-60 mph in five seconds without a trailer attached. \n\nThe big rig has an impressive range of 500 miles per charge. With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said.

I Tried The Tom Brady Diet And Nutrition Plan,Business Insider,25.0,16456.0,299.0,44.0,40.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZvdTNDMru78/default.jpg,"I tried the intense diet and fitness regimens that 40-year-old NFL quarterback Tom Brady touts in his new book The TB 12 Method. Along with a diet that's heavy on vegetables and lean protein, Brady stays away from alcohol, caffeine, dairy, and sugar. \n\nThis is what it was like to eat and train like Tom Brady for a week, including a taste test of the avocado ice cream Brady is known to enjoy. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nI just tried the Tom Brady diet for a week. So, Tom Brady's got this new book called The TB12 Method. In the book, he outlines in detail the fitness regimens he undertakes and diet as well. Tom Brady's nutrition plan definitely made me tweak my already-okay diet. \n\nIn terms of the food that I ate during the week, you're staying away from sugars and dairies and refined carbohydrates, etc. It's a lot of vegetables, lean white meats. We had ground turkey burgers over lots of greens, peppers, and carrots. We also had a grilled chicken breast, some Brussels sprouts, and then quinoa. Then during the day, I would eat an apple. I would eat almonds.\n\nTom Brady is all about the hydration and constantly drinking water. It's recommended that you take your total body weight, cut that in half, and then drink the corresponding amount of ounces of water that's half your body weight. Every day I would drink approximately 90 ounces of water. Three big Poland Spring bottles of water.\n\nIn terms of caffeine, I usually drink like four cups of coffee a day on average, which is a lot. It's too much. Tom Brady — he does not drink caffeine, but he recommended a maximum amount of 200 milligrams of caffeine a day,  and that equals two cups of coffee.\n\nIn terms of alcohol, Tom Brady, in the book, says that he does occasionally have a cocktail, but he says that, if you're going to drink alcohol, you need to match the ounce-amount of alcohol that you drink with water. So if you have a 12-ounce beer, you need to drink a 12-ounce glass of water.\n\nOne of the dishes that I tried was the avocado ice cream, which Tom Brady's been famous for making before. I wasn't a fan of the avocado ice cream. Sorry, Tom.\n\nOverall, the Tom Brady TB12 experience was a big improvement over my regular routine. I love always focusing on eating healthy and avoiding unhealthy, rich, sugary foods. I think this is definitely a positive tweak for me. I feel like it's already had a positive impact on me. \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Earthquake Preparedness Kit,BuzzFeed Nifty,26.0,26230.0,962.0,37.0,102.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c8DogLWrs90/default.jpg,"Earthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don’t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you’ll need, medications, and supplies that you’ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don’t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt’s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"

Trump Breaks Silence On Roy Moore And Offers De-Facto Endorsement,Business Insider,25.0,3892.0,35.0,14.0,91.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrK2j4cPxSc/default.jpg,"President Donald Trump implicitly endorsed embattled GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore on Tuesday, telling reporters that we don't need a liberal Democrat in that seat as he left the White House for a Thanksgiving trip to Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nRoy Moore denies it — that's all I can say, he said, breaking a silence on the sexual misconduct allegations levied against Moore by nearly 10 women. The allegations include incidents with women under the age of 16 when he was in his 30s.\n\nMoore has vehemently denied the allegations. But he has done little over the past few weeks to clear up what has emerged as a pattern from the women.\n\nAnd by the way, he totally denies it, Trump said. The president also said the recent spike in women coming forward to share their stories of being sexually harassed or assaulted by powerful men is a good thing for US society.\n\nTrump, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct from more than a dozen women during last year's presidential campaign — claims he said were all lies — had not previously addressed the Moore allegations. But amid his trip to Asia, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump believed if the allegations are true, Moore will do the right thing and step aside.\n\nTrump's comments come a day after White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox & Friends that Democratic nominee Doug Jones, the candidate running against Moore in Alabama, will be a vote against tax cuts and is weak on crime. Though she didn't explicitly tell viewers to vote for Moore, she said, I'm telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through.\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Tuesday that Conway spoke with Trump about the Alabama Senate race prior to appearing on the Fox News morning show.\n\nIn a Tuesday press conference, Dean Young, a strategist for Moore's campaign, said Conway's comments amounted to an endorsement of their candidate from the White House.\n\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter and an assistant to him in the White House, told The Associated Press that there is a special place in hell for people who prey on children.\n\nI've yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims' accounts, she said.\n\nMoore has been disavowed by most of the Republican elected officials in Washington, DC. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican National Committee had already withdrawn their support for his candidacy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL’s poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?"
Parenting Habits That Could Keep Children From Succeeding In Life,Business Insider,25.0,37705.0,961.0,51.0,228.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WKcYTvyoidw/default.jpg,"Raising children requires good parenting techniques as well as avoiding bad habits.  A positive body image help children develop socially. Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://simonscat.theofficialwebshop.com/"

Does Turkey Make You Sleepy?,Tech Insider,28.0,12787.0,337.0,13.0,105.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TncLBbJ8SZo/default.jpg,"The tryptophan in turkey gets a bad rap every Thanksgiving. Here's the real reason you're so tired. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nDr. Daniel Barone: So the myth is that turkey has a lot of a chemical known as tryptophan, which is actually the precursor to melatonin. So people think that when you, around Thanksgiving time, when you have a lot of turkey, that makes you tired because of all the tryptophan that you're eating gets produced into melatonin and then it makes us fall asleep.\n\nThat’s actually not true, the reason why we tend to be tired after we have a large meal of Thanksgiving is simply because of the amount of food that we're having we have what's called postprandial fatigue, which is basically after you've had a big meal your body goes into basically shutdown mode and sleep gets promoted.\n\nThat's why that's why a lot of other countries have siestas for this reason. After lunch, the body goes into postprandial fatigue and then having a little nap can be can be very nice.\n\nAfter we have a big meal, especially around lunchtime, the body just naturally has its own internal clock which tells us that we should be falling asleep around that time.\n\nFalling asleep or being in a relaxed state after you've had a meal helps somebody digest it and use those nutrients to heal the body and repair the damage that’s occurred.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

A Chinese takeout container unfolds into a plate! \nRemove the metal handle from the box, and unfold the tabs on either side. It will unfold into a convenient paper plate!  \n\n2. You probably don't realize it, but your pots come with built-in spoon rests.\nDon’t rest your stirring spoon on the kitchen counter, it will only spread mess! Instead, put your spoon into the hole at the end of your pot handle.\n\n3.You've been dispensing Tic Tacs the hard way.\nYou probably dispense your mints by furiously shaking the box upside down, only for a heap of them to spill out. Instead turn the box upside down, slowly open the lid, and then pull the box back. A single mint will be sitting in a tic tac-shaped groove inside the lid. \n\n4. Play Doh is for cleaning wallpaper.\nWhat now is an iconic, squishy, children's toy, was originally invented for the purpose of cleaning wallpaper.\n\n5. Your bobby pins are on upside down\nThe correct way to wear a bobby pin is the flat side up for maximum hold! \n\n6. Does your foil roll never stay in the box?\nMost aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and kitchen paper rolls come with punch-in tabs on either sides of the box. The tabs hold the roller in place as you pull on your foil. \n\n7. You're probably using the wrong plunger.\nThe classic brown suction cupped plunger is actually for clearing blockages in a sink, not your toilet! A toilet plunger has a double thrust force cup to help get deep down into the block and has extra force for tough clogs. \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/33836\n\n\nMUSIC\nBoss Man\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc."

DON'T Buy The iPhone X,Unbox Therapy,28.0,3412680.0,168804.0,13699.0,46196.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2fGXDFiFBhg/default.jpg,"I used the iPhone X for 2 weeks. I don’t think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

It has an unused output on the print head, that can be controlled from within gcode. That opens up a ton of possibilities, but what I am most interested in is, as always, laser PCB prototyping. Will that work? Spoiler: Yes, it will. Incredibly well."

Following the announcement of the big four categories, the Recording Academy revealed the rest of the nominees online. Jay Z leads the pack with 8 nominations this year including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Rap Album. Kendrick Lamar follows with 7 noms including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rap Album. Bruno Mars is next in line with 6 nominations and SZA is the most nominated female with five.\n\nJoining Jay Z and Kendrick in the Album of the Year category is Childish Gambino’s “Awaken, My Love!”, Lorde’s “Melodrama”, and Bruno Mars “24k Magic”. Record of the Year continues the male-heavy theme with this years nominees Jay Z “The Story of OJ”, “Kendrick Lamar “Humble”, Bruno Mars “24k Magic”, Childish Gambino’s “Redbone”, and Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber for “Despacito”. The unstoppable “Despacito” trio are also nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop/ Duo Group Performance giving Justin 3 Grammy nominations.\n\nJoining “Despacito” for Song of the Year which celebrates songwriters are Jay Z’s “4:44”, Julia Michaels “Issues”, Logic’s “1-800-273-8255”, and Bruno Mars “That’s What I Like”. In the coveted Best New Artist category we’ve got Alessia Cara, Khalid, Lil Uzi Vert, Julia Michaels, and SZA are all up for the award. You’ll see more familiar names in the Best Pop Solo Performance which includes Kelly Clarkson’s “Love So Soft”, Kesha’s “Praying”, Lady Gaga’s “Million Reasons”, Pink “What About Us”, and Ed Sheeran “Shape of You”. \n\nIf you were counting on seeing Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” on the noms list, rest assured the eligibility period for the 2018 Grammys was October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017. “Look What You Made Me Do” was released in August so it’s eligible for this year but the rest of Taylor’s “Reputation” album will be eligible for the 2019 show. However, Taylor did snag two noms this year including her Best Song Written for Visual Media for her Fifty Shades Darker song “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” and as a songwriter for Best Country Song in Little Big Town’s “Better Man”. \n\nWe gotta say, we’re surprised that we don’t see Ed Sheeran’s name a little more here, and where is Harry Styles? The Grammys will air live from Madison Square Garden in NYC on Sunday January 28th. So what is your first REACTION to the Grammy noms? Get to typing in the comments below!

How Easy It Is For The Us President To Launch A Nuclear Weapon,Business Insider,25.0,43774.0,959.0,44.0,218.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FA_gIAGNDQ8/default.jpg,"The steps the president has to take to fire a nuke are involved and complicated, but they work to safeguard against accidental launches and miscommunications.\n\nThat said, the entire process could happen in just a few short minutes. The following is a transcription of the animation.\n\nIt can take the US government just minutes to launch a nuclear weapon. Here's how it would work.\n\nThe president has the sole authority to call for a nuclear strike. Once the call is made, a series of critical steps follow.\n\nThe president first meets with top military advisers. The meeting would take place in the Situation Room. If the president is traveling, a call is made on a secure line.\n\nIf the president still wants to go through with the strike, the order is verified. To authenticate the order, a challenge code is read to the president. It's usually two phonetic letters like Delta-Echo.\n\nThe president then receives the biscuit, a laminated card that's always near the president. The biscuit has the matching response to the challenge code.\n\nThe Pentagon then broadcasts an encoded message to missile crews. The message is only about the length of a standard tweet.\n\nIt includes the war plan, Sealed Authentication System or (SAS) codes, and the actual missile launch codes. When the launch crews get the message they open lock safes to obtain the SAS codes. These codes are compared with the SAS codes included in the message.\n\nIf fired from a submarine the captain, executive officer, and two others authenticate the launch order. Fifteen minutes after receiving the order, the missiles could be ready to launch.\n\nIf fired from land, there are 50 missiles controlled by 5 launch crews in different locations. Each crew votes for the launch by turning their keys at the same time.\n\nThere are five different keys, but only two need to be turned to launch the missiles. In this scenario, the missiles could be ready to launch just minutes after the president's order. Once the missiles are launched, there's no turning back.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Twitter Is FURIOUS VS Fashion Show Aired Model's Runway Fall UNEDITED,Clevver News,24.0,201689.0,2208.0,94.0,376.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6d6SmcYcP_U/default.jpg,"Thank you to Xfinity Mobile for sponsoring this episode. Learn more about Xfinity Mobile – a new kind of network that combines America’s largest most reliable 4G LTE with the most WiFi hotspots. http://bit.ly/XFINITY_MOBILE\n\nMore Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nWelp, turns out CBS decided not to edit out model Ming Xi (SHEE)’s fall during last night’s airing of the Victoria Secret fashion show. This episode of Newsfeed is brought to you by Xfinity Mobile. It’s a new kind of network.\n\nSooo that’s embarrassing…\n\nRumor was that CBS would probably edit out Ming’s fall on the catwalk at last week’s pre-taped Victoria Secret fashion show…After all, CBS has taken out other awkward flubs at the show in the past, like last year when Ariana Grande got smacked in the face with angel wings. But that was not the case with this tumble.\nYa know why they didn’t cut this out? Because it was TV gold and great publicity. I mean, we’re talking about it right now and so are most media outlets. To amp up the drama further, they sliced in backstage audio from the producers. Check this out…\n\nIt’s truly like a car crash. I don’t want to look, but I have to. My friend and editor at Cosmopolitan, Alex Rees, shares my sentiments, tweeting…”omg and she's crying (tbh its a bit f-ed up to air this part imho but then i recorded the footage to share on twitter so i dont really have a point i guess).”\nIt got even sadder when they show Ming in tears after exiting the runway.\n\nFans have been vocal about their feelings about the final edit of the show on twitter. \n\nOne viewer tweeted, “Pretty uncool of Victoria's Secret to not only show Ming Xi fall, but then also show her crying backstage.”\nAnother viewer was annoyed that they didn’t use footage from the dress rehearsal instead writing, “The vsfs is filmed twice. I’m disgusted that they showed Ming Xi fall, like honestly? Why did they do her like that? They embarrassed her in front of millions of people. I’m so disappointed in Victoria Secret right now.”\n\nUgh, poor, Ming. And if you thought it couldn’t be more embarrassing…the fall happened in front of a hometown crowd in Shanghai. The model wrote this in an Instagram caption following the incident last week. \n\n“It was no doubt one of the hardest moments I have ever had to go through in my career, especially since the show was taking place in my hometown, in front of my mother's and my people's eyes. However, the support I received from everyone yesterday was incredible and I am truly grateful to everyone who was there for me.”\n\nI know they’re supposed to be “angels, but am I horrible for saying I appreciated this humanizing moment. We got to see genuine emotion, a fall… literally and figuritively… and a strong recovery. It’s kind of a hero story for me. What do you think?! Let me know in the comments section below. I’m your host Ashley Iaconetti, thanks for tuning in to Clevver. \n\nNow click left to see Harry Styles get his grove on the Victoria Secret fashion show.

Top 10 Strangest Things That Happen To Your Body In Space,Be Amazed,24.0,47661.0,1292.0,70.0,183.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MQSRmx9zS64/default.jpg,"Space is the final frontier. Being in zero gravity for extended periods of time does some wacky things to the human body. Unless aliens show up and teach us how to deal with these unique challenges, it’s up to scientists to discover ways for the human body to cope.\nSubscribe for more! ► http://bit.ly/BeAmazedSubscribe ◄\nStay updated ► http://bit.ly/BeAmazedFacebook https://twitter.com/BeAmazedVideos https://instagram.com/BeAmazedVideos ◄ \nFor copyright queries or general inquiries please get in touch: beamazedvideos@gmail.com\nCredit: https://pastebin.com/zqUjCLhq\n\nBe Amazed at these Top 10 Things That Happen To Your Body In Space! Muscle Atrophy - Gravity, of course, is what allows you to walk around on the earth with your feet on the ground. In space, your main mode of transportation is floating instead.  Space Eurphoria - The mind is the most important part of the body, so how is it affected by living up in space? Many astronauts have reported that their time in space was a seriously enlightening and perspective changing time of their life. Space Radiation - Luckily for us down here on earth, our atmosphere protects us from cosmic radiation. However, Astronauts outside this atmosphere - out in space - do not have this luxurious blanket, and so they're exposed to ten times more radiation than they would be if they were on earth. Vision problems - If you spend too much time in space, the backs of your eyeballs will flatten just a tiny little bit. This is as bad as it sounds, and it causes your vision to blur. \n\nA Strange Smell - One question that isn’t really explored in many science fiction books or films is what exactly does space smell like? Wouldn’t it just smell like whatever earth smells like? Space Adaption Syndrome - If you go too long without earths’ gravity holding down your body, you could end up with “space sickness”, formally known as space adaption syndrome. Confinement Craziness - If you have a family, a roommate, or have even simply interacted with another human being, you should know that if you put a bunch of people in a confined area for an extended period of time, problems are bound to arise. Your immune system gets worse - Space also takes a toll on your immune system, which you need to protect your body against diseases more than ever in space. You’ll lose bone mass - Here on earth, you maintain your bones thanks to the natural power of gravity and mechanical loading. Osteoblasts, which are cells that regulate the bone matrix, and osteoclasts, which absorb one matrix, continually remodel your bone mass. Your heart weakens - The heart, perhaps the most important muscle you have, is also affected by a lack of gravity. The very size and shape of the human heart is changed by a trip to space."
How to Time Travel,Tech Insider,28.0,114918.0,4090.0,106.0,643.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/olOdCkYIsrA/default.jpg,"Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival, explains what we know about time travel so far. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nBrian Greene: I’m Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.\n\nIt's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.\n\nWe know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It’s surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.\n\nHe also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity — a neutron star, a black hole — and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.\n\nThis is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel — to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.\n\nThe main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really … Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.\n\nIt's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole — put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey — then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel — through this wormhole — you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.\n\nNow again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

By February 28, Scooby was tearing down the tide at 45 miles an hour on his rattling surfboard. There was a 70-foot mountain of water avalanching behind him.\n\nThe seething spume nipped him from behind and sent him bombing into the fray in a violent back flop.\n\nScooby’s friend and fellow Brazilian, Lucas Chumbo Chianca, rode in on a jet ski to pick him up before the next monster set rolled in. Scooby grabbed ahold of a rear tow board latched to the jet ski, and they sped away in an attempt to outrun the next wave. Chumbo soon lost control in the choppy whitewater, and the jet ski capsized near some dangerous rocks. Another massive wave was right behind them. \nTwo people now needed a rescue. \nHow did Scooby and Chumbo finally escape the chaos? Everaldo Pato Teixeira, a veteran big wave surfer from Brazil, tore in on yet another jet ski. In a deft and coolheaded rescue bolstered by years of experience, Teixeira rescued Chumbo and Scooby, both of whom were relatively unscathed.\n\nThis episode ended well and became one of the main highlights of the Big Wave Season, the drone video went viral after it was used on a Red Bull Production and later licensed to National Geographic, reaching 20 million views in few days, dozens of media outlets picked up the story, the footage is currently being licensed for several feature documentaries across the globe, and is now perhaps the most viewed piece of footage of Nazaré.\n\n** The Big Ugly was an Official Nominee for the Los Angeles Drone Film Festival 2017 edition, featured on VICE/Motherboard.\n\n*** UPDATE (Dec 3, 2017): The Big Ugly is the Winner of the News & Documentary Award on the #LADFF Los Angeles Drone Film Festival 2017 edition\n----------\n\nCopyright © 2017, Máquina Voadora, all rights reserved\nFilmed and Edited by: Máquina Voadora\nFeatured Surfers: Pedro Scooby, Lucas Chumbo, Everaldo Pato Teixeira\nMusic: Drive by Ross Bugden (https://youtu.be/3pZdZiPnsGs) \nLocation: Praia do Norte, Nazaré - Portugal\n__________________________\nThe footage in this video is protected by copyright.

I am fan  from Czech Republic. I grew up watching 90´s X-Men cartoon and i loved it. I like X-Men movies but i was really disappointed in the portrayal of my favourite character, Gambit. I was looking forward for his solo movie. But I don't hear any news anymore. It´s that movie still happening or not?\n\nJessica Kang - I wanted to know your thoughts on the upcoming Lucille Ball biopic.  As a HUGE Lucille Ball fan, it amazes me that they haven’t done a proper biopic on her yet.  She had such a fascinating life and I would love to see the backstage drama told without any sugarcoat.  Love your insight and your logic and of course, keep bringing on the filthy!\n\nTaylor Pechter - I've watched the Inifinty War trailer a few times. I enjoyed it, but one thing gave me pause. At the end of the trailer, you have The Avengers running at another army of faceless, canon-fodder monsters. Do you think this is the climax? I hope not because this has been a trope ever since the first Avengers and is kind of becoming tiresome. What do you think? \n\nAlijah Brown - Hey John deadpool 2 will definitely be a smash hit next year or at least that's what I assume. How do you think the film will hold up against a super blockbuster like Infinity war. 2018 is certainly packed with comic book movies. A lot of competition. Your thoughts?\n\nRoger Daultry - There are reports that Bryan Singer has gone awol several times during the shooting of the Queen Biopic and Fox has just halted production because of Singer’s “unexpected unavailability”. His publicist put out a statement that it’s because of a family health matter. My question is: Do you believe him or is there a deeper problem happening here? I really want a great Queen movie!"

Loved Coco, and the short wasn’t bad, but at north of 20 minutes long it just made for a lot longer evening for the kids than I was banking on. Did Disney actually hear the complaints and pull it from the screenings?\n\nHussain Shah - Hi John, congrats on 100,000 subs just waiting for the other 900,000 to find your fantastic channel. I'm wondering your thoughts on Netflix's Oscar chances? Do you feel they'll have a chance or do the academy just have a prejudice against online streaming? They're releasing a film a week next year, surely one will get recognised at least. \n\nVictor - Hi John, awesome show. Super baffled by 20th Century Fox’s decision to fire Bryan Singer from the Bohemian Rhapsody movie - especially after reading Singer’s comments about needing time for family health issues. Is this a smart move by 20th Century Fox? Why not keep him on board in some advisory capacity, whilst bringing in a co-director who can complete shooting? Something doesn’t add up... Thanks!\n\nZR J-Ro - My question was could Tarintino’s Star Trek be Rated R since most of, if not not all, of his movies are?\n\nRebecca VanDerween - I’m seeing a lot of excitement for Avengers Infinity War. The trailer was just amazing. But after the recent choke job of Justice League, should we be nervous that Infinity War could crash and burn like it did? Why should we feel confident that Avengers will work where Justice League failed?"

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles.\n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.  Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission.  Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.  Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  \n\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.  They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles.\n\nDirected by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly.  Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment.  Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer."

Could Kevin Feige Save DC? Does Alita Battle Angel Look Great Or Terrible?

Django (Tarantino’s record) made $425mil. I fear many people, especially families, will avoid it because of assumptions drawn from Tarantino's past films. Even the general audience knows his movies are more extreme than average R-rated films. \n\nMathew Garet - Kind of a random question, do you find it as odd as I do that, JA Bayona isn't the one announcing trailers on social media, but it was actually Colin Trevorrow? Appreciate everything you do John! \n\nSamuel Polay - I just watched the trailer for Alita battle angel and my reaction can be summed in one word: disturbed. How did nobody at the studio notice these effects on Alita and immediately mandate reshoots that use just the actress' real face instead of this uncanny valley monstrosity? \n\nSebastian Dietz - Hey John, like always greetings from germany ;) in my opinion one of the first things disney should do after buying fox‘s assets is split the production auf Avatar 2 and 3. (Yes i’m in the doubting J. Cameron business ;)) If Avatar 2 fails (and i think there are huge arguments that it could) it’s a big risk to already have spend the money on the production of the 3rd one. Much like the situation of JL and Aquaman. Thoughts?\nBryan K - If DC and WB offered Kevin Feige a huge pay bump to jump ship to build their DCU do you think Kevin would go and would you want him to? Kevin has already done so much for Marvel he may won't a new challenge and fresh start?\n\n**DC logo art by Piebytwo"

Here's how it works.\n\nSome people would have filmed their script on the ground, and just messed about while floating. I decided to go for something a bit more challenging.\n\n**\n\nIf you're a masters or PhD student from an ESA member state, and zero-g sounds like your thing, have a look at the Fly Your Thesis program: http://www.esa.int/Education/Fly_Your_Thesis -- the 2017-18 submissions are closed, but that just gives you time to start planning for next year...\n\n**\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhy isn't Neil floating around the cabin in zero-g?: Sometimes, his feet are under a safety strap, so he doesn't drift away. Sometimes, he's holding on with one hand, and he's just that good at zero-g maneuvers.\n\nWhy's my face so red?: During the 1.8g phase, my heart has to work extra hard to pump blood up to my head -- when I switch to 0g, it takes a few seconds for it to slow pumping, so my blood pressure spikes.\n\nWhat stabilised camera did I use?: You're looking at footage from a GoPro Fusion, stabilised in post using Adobe After Effects and the telemetry from the plane's sensors.\n\nWhat did it feel like?: There'll be a behind-the-scenes video on the Matt and Tom channel on Saturday, hopefully!\n\n**\n\nCamera: Melanie Cowan\n\nThank you to everyone at ESA and Novespace who helped make this happen!\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

Who cares! As VICE News' Jay Kang told us, “It’s impossible right now to not get rich if you own any Bitcoin.”\n\nKang first got the Bitcoin bug in July, initially investing $4000, upping it to $9000, then fearing a crash, betting his entire crypto-cache on a random soccer game (which he lost). A former aspiring professional poker player, Kang bounced back undeterred, and with the surging price of the currency, Bitcoin mania has taken over his life. He claims 10 percent of his net worth is now invested in cryptocurrency.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"

In an interview with Variety at the Dubai International Film Festival, David Harbour – aka Chief Jim Hopper – revealed that the third season of the hit sci-fi series probably won’t hit Netflix until 2019! It’s not even 2018 now. That means we might have to wait more than a year to get the goods of season 3.\n\nAs soon as those words came out of his mouth the internet went into a frenzy, with fans around the globe tweeting angry gifs with the text “When you realize you have to wait until 2013 for season 3 of stranger things.” Now, the good news is that while we impatiently wait, the Duffer brothers responsible for those amazing scripts are working hard to create an unforgettable third season. \n\nChief Hopper even revealed that the writers basically just sit in their apartments day in and day out for like 12-14 hours a day and just WRITE. And we thank you for your service. On another note, the weekend that Stranger Things was released gave Netflix its biggest streaming day in the UK in all of 2017. By Sunday, October 29th, many fans had literally binged the entire second season in under 24 hours. \n\nLet’s learn our lesson and take our time in season 3. But I want to hear from you: how you feeling that we might have to wait like a thousand years for the next season. Between the wait time for Game of Thrones and now Stranger Things, I might just give up on TV altogether. It’s becoming so cruel! Anyway, share your thoughts below on what your predictions for season 3 are and your favorite show you’re currently waiting on.

No single notes. \n\nA tritone is referring to a particular musical interval (how far away two notes are from each other) and is renowned for it's dissonance and harsh feeling of tension. A tritone name refers to the 3 whole tone distance between the two notes.\n\nIt's used to great effect in a lot of different genres, but straight up 2 note only tritone chords I most closely associate with Deathcore. And I can't think of anywhere else where it's used anywhere near as often. Particular the band Oceano came to mind while writing this.\n\nIt's rumored that the tritone was banned in medieval times, that you could be jailed for using it, that people believed it could summon the devil...  None of which are actually true, but make for a great story that really fits in well with this harsh musical interval.\n\nHere's me chatting about writing this after being thrust into the underworld: https://youtu.be/651DVX5w3Ow\n\nMixed by Ryan Fluff Bruce: https://www.youtube.com/user/Fluff191\nVideo edit by Jake Jarvi: https://www.youtube.com/pineappleboyfilms/\n\nThis video was made possible because of Patreon support from Tianyu Ge, Navin Antoine, Brad Tucker, Jaz Maglana, Blayd Malburne, Andrew Johnston, Cody Melcher, Caleb Chalfin, Otto Cate, Nicolette Kawata, Tyler Feinman, Haroon Rahman, Quintin Waldner, Hypergnome, Stefan Gunn, Andy AKA VaultsOfExtoth, Rob Harper, & many other awesome people on my Patreon page: http://www.patreon.com/RobScallon\nThank you so much!\n\nMusic videos go on the main.

Steelers Robbed By NFL Of Win Over Patriots,Blurred Culture,17.0,19048.0,172.0,83.0,475.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D0N3qaqXymY/default.jpg,"It seemed like the Pittsburgh Steelers won and tight end Jesse James would be the hero with a game-winning touchdown catch in the final minute against the New England Patriots. But if you’ve watched the NFL long enough, you know that a catch is often not a catch.\n\nThe NFL’s oft-criticized catch rule might determine where the AFC championship game is held. In the final seconds of a thrilling game Sunday, James caught a pass just short of the goal line, and as he was going down he crossed the goal line for what looked like a touchdown. In the CBS booth, Tony Romo and Jim Nantz couldn’t figure out why it was taking so long for replay review to confirm it.\n\nhttp://BlurredCulture.com"

Star Wars The Last Jedi Scores An A Cinemascore And 2nd Largest Opening Ever - The John Campea Show,John Campea,24.0,33929.0,1075.0,160.0,894.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v_5qKt7M5fM/default.jpg,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Satruday, December 16th 2017) John discusses the following topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nRT - My question is on how Netflix makes money on their original shows. Do people really subscribe because of Stranger Things or Punisher and will anyone drop out when it's over?  I didn't and I won't. Thanks for taking my question. \n\nPATREON Supporter Ali Hussein - Hi John greeting from Sweden love your show. My question is: Now that fox Disney deal is done. When do you think Disney/Marvel going to announced the new cast for X-Men. Do you think before 2020 or after. Love do hear your thoughts.\n\nJoshua Martin - With Disney's recent acquisition of Fox properties, namely the X-men/Deadpool and F4, does this give Disney/Marvel more power or leverage to either 1. Renegotiate their deal with Sony (after homecoming 2) to allow more Spiderman characters into the MCU at their control (or simply buy them) or 2. Buy back the rights to Hulk and Namor from Universal?\n\nRene Bernard - Hey John. CNN reported that Star Wars: The Last Jedi became the second largest opening Thursday night movie in history with $45 million dollars. With those numbers, do you still think it won’t catch The Force Awakens opening weekend box office record?"

Joining Rivers are The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogies three-time Academy Award®-winning filmmakers Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, who have penned the screenplay.  The Universal and MRC adaptation is from the award-winning book series by Philip Reeve, published in 2001 by Scholastic.  \n\nOn board as producers are Zane Weiner (The Hobbit trilogy), Amanda Walker (The Hobbit trilogy) and Deborah Forte (Goosebumps), as well as Walsh and Jackson.

I don't like doing heavy makeup when it's cold outside although I'm not really sure why that is since theoretically my makeup should last longer..（｡･Д･｡）??? \n\nI played with shimmery and glittery shadows today as well. I usually prefer matte eyeshadows but since this look is so natural, I had to add some ✧・ﾟ:* sparkle *:・ﾟ✧ to the eyes\n\nThroughout summer, I like to use coral blushes across my nose to get the sunkissed effect but when winter comes, I switch to pastel blushes. You know how your face gets flushed when you've been out in the cold for too long? I think pastel blushes capture that perfectly ! in a cute way + without the being cold part (⁎❝᷀ົ ˙̫ ❝᷀ົ⁎)\n\nAre you traveling anywhere this winter?

Directed by Nash Edgerton. In Theaters March 9.\n\nWatch the greenband trailer now: http://bit.ly/GringoOfficialTrailer\n\nAn exhilarating mix of dark comedy, white-knuckle action and dramatic intrigue, Gringo joyrides into Mexico, where mild-mannered businessman Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) finds himself at the mercy of his back-stabbing business colleagues back home, local drug lords and a morally conflicted black-ops mercenary. Crossing the line from law-abiding citizen to wanted criminal, Harold battles to survive his increasingly dangerous situation in ways that raise the question: Is he out of his depth — or two steps ahead?\n\n#GringoMovie\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AmazonVideoSubscribe\n» In Theaters March 9\n\nAbout Gringo:\nMild-mannered pharmaceutical company executive Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo) takes a business trip from Chicago to Mexico with his cutthroat bosses Richard (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine (Charlize Theron). At the company’s Mexican lab, Richard orders manager Sanchez (Hernán Mendoza) to stop selling the bioengineered marijuana product Cannabax to a brutal, Beatles-loving cartel kingpin known as The Black Panther. Meanwhile, straight-arrow Harold learns he’ll be out of a job as soon as Richard and Elaine sell their newly cleaned-up company to a conglomerate. And when he turns to his wife Bonnie (Thandie Newton) back home for comfort, she confesses via Skype that she’s having an affair.\n\nTargeted by the ruthless Black Panther, who hopes to gain access to the Cannabax formula, Harold disappears before his bosses return to Chicago. A few hours later they receive a call informing them he’s been kidnapped, and his captors are demanding a $5 million ransom. Rather than pay, Richard dispatches his mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch (Sharlto Copley) to extract Harold. But even with some temporary assistance from warmhearted American tourist Sunny (Amanda Seyfried) and her drug-mule boyfriend Miles (Harry Treadaway), Harold’s prospects for survival grow dimmer by the minute.\n\nPursued by an army of attackers, Harold crosses the line from mild-mannered citizen to wanted criminal. But is he out of his depth? Or two steps ahead? An action-comedy roller-coaster ride brimming with black humor, white-knuckle car chases and double-dealing, Gringo takes the concept of adventure travel to a whole new level.\nDirected by Nash Edgerton, who made his feature-length directorial debut with the acclaimed Australian thriller The Square, Gringo is written by Anthony Tambakis and Matthew Stone and produced by Rebecca Yeldham, Nash Edgerton, Beth Kono, A.J.

Living under a bridge doesn't stop this homeless woman from staying positive.,Invisible People,29.0,33685.0,1450.0,51.0,638.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xYShiXMGULE/default.jpg,"A few months back I logged onto Facebook and was greeted by a smiling homeless woman's selfie in front of a tent holding up a cup of coffee. It was captioned good morning. Today, I met Manda at her homeless encampment where she made me a cup of coffee!\n\nMost of the time I meet homeless people in person on the streets or in a homeless shelter. Then we often connect online and become friends. Manda and I became friends online first. I got to know her a little before seeing how she survives homelessness.  I am having a hard time processing it all. Lots of emotions both good and bad right now! \n\nManda is an amazing woman. She is disabled from severe brain trauma, yet because she is high functioning, she falls through the gaps in the safety net. I have been working with her trying to help find a path out of homelessness, but the walls bureaucracy are impossible to break through. \n\nFor all the people that believe homeless people are lazy, I wish they could just spend an hour in Manda's shoes! She works hard to keep her tent camp clean. She works hard getting to treatment and therapy. She works hard every single day trying to survive. And she works extremely hard to stay positive while facing the madness of homelessness each and every day! \n\nWe must get Manda out from under that bridge into housing. Because of her health and being a woman out on the streets, she is extremely vulnerable living outside. If you are connected to social services in Seattle or know anyone that is, please reach out to them and forward Manda's story. I have talked to her social worker. Her health issues are severe, and we need to get this woman inside! \n\nManda vlogs on her Facebook page you can find here https://www.facebook.com/mandycampmom/\n\nIf you'd like to help support her directly this is her GoFundMe page https://www.gofundme.com/4qcfk0o\n\nYou can also find Manda on Twitter https://twitter.com/RicherAmanda\n\n________________________________________________\n\nSubscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/c/invisiblepeople?sub_confirmation=1\n\nInvisible People's website:\n\nhttp://invisiblepeople.tv\n\nSupport Invisible People:\n\nhttps://invisiblepeople.tv/donate\n\nOn Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/invisiblepeople\n\nInvisible People's Social Media: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://twitter.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://www.instagram.com/invisiblepeople\nhttps://www.facebook.com/invisiblepeopletv\n\nMark Horvath's Twitter: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/hardlynormal\n\nAbout Invisible People: \n\nSince its launch in November 2008, Invisible People has leveraged the power of video and the massive reach of social media to share the compelling, gritty, and unfiltered stories of homeless people from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. The vlog (video blog) gets up close and personal with veterans, mothers, children, layoff victims and others who have been forced onto the streets by a variety of circumstances. Each week, they're on InvisiblePeople.tv, and high traffic sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, proving to a global audience that while they may often be ignored, they are far from invisible.\n\nInvisible People goes beyond the rhetoric, statistics, political debates, and limitations of social services to examine poverty in America via a medium that audiences of all ages can understand, and can't ignore. The vlog puts into context one of our nation's most troubling and prevalent issues through personal stories captured by the lens of Mark Horvath – its founder – and brings into focus the pain, hardship and hopelessness that millions face each day. One story at a time, videos posted on InvisiblePeople.tv shatter the stereotypes of America's homeless, force shifts in perception and deliver a call to action that is being answered by national brands, nonprofit organizations and everyday citizens now committed to opening their eyes and their hearts to those too often forgotten.\n\nInvisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to changing the way we think about people experiencing homelessness."

A good old-fashioned a cappella sing-off, that’s what. In late November the San Francisco Conservatory of Music hosted the fifth annual installment of “Techapella,”a showcase for the a cappella singing clubs of some of the most powerful companies in the world.\n\nThe event was founded by Laolee Xiong, a security specialist at Facebook. It was initially a way to have a competition with his friends who sang in Google’s group, “Googapella.” Then he mentioned it to his friend at Google and suggested that they do “some kind of Pitch Perfect-style sing-off,” said Xiong.\n\nAfter an informal singing battle at each of the tech giant’s campuses, the a cappella groups from other companies (Twitter has “The Song Birds” and Pinterest has “the Pintunes”) reached out to Xiong to organize a larger event, and “Techapella” was born. More than 1,500 fans attended the two-night event.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"

When his glamorous mother (Bette Midler) is forced to send him to live with his straight-laced father (Larry Pine), Billy finds himself a diva-out-of-water at his new ultra-conservative high school. Undaunted by the bullies who don’t understand him, the fearless Billy sets out to make a big statement in his own inimitable way: challenging the school’s reigning mean girl (Abigail Breslin) for the title of homecoming queen. This proudly offbeat comedy is an irresistible ode to outsiders and nonconformists of all stripes. \n\n#IFCFilms #Freakshow\n\nSubscribe to IFC: http://youtube.com/user/IFCFilmsTube\n\nConnect with IFC Online\nIFC Films Official Site: http://www.ifcfilms.com\nFollow IFC Films on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IFCFilms\nFind IFC Films on Facebook: http://facebook.com/IFCFilmsOfficial\nFollow IFC Films on Instagram : http://instagram.com/ifcfilms"

Lost in Light II,Sriram Murali,28.0,7938.0,430.0,9.0,42.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/doHVMJnuvDA/default.jpg,"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"

Lost in Light II - a short film on Light Pollution,Sriram Murali,28.0,22664.0,1052.0,25.0,84.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/doHVMJnuvDA/default.jpg,"instagram.com/sriram_murali\n\nLost in Light II is a short film showing how light pollution affects the view of the night skies using one of the most prominent constellations - The Orion. The success and reach of my previous film(youtu.be/j2hNaT56FUY) - made the news in over 40 countries and published on National Geographic, inspired me to make a follow up to help people even better relate to night skies and further raise awareness on light pollution.\n\nOne thing I realized from my last film was that people were able to relate to the difference between the light pollution levels but not the Milky Way itself. The Milky Way appears more colorful to a camera than it does to our eyes and most people haven’t seen it. But, the Orion is a more common sight. It’s a great subject to help explain light pollution.\n\nAstronomy is a humbling and character building experience like Carl Sagan puts it. Being under a sky full of stars makes you feel tiny, humble, kind and caring. But, thanks to light pollution, most people lack this connection. Millions of kids are robbed of finding their passion for Astronomy. We've lost the potential for thousands of great minds. We are losing our identity only increasing the difference between us.\n\nIn less than hundred years, we have drastically altered our night time environment. Light pollution affects our health, disrupts our sleep patterns, increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, hormonal disorders and other diseases. Millions of birds are killed each year colliding into brightly lit buildings. Baby sea turtles(hatchlings) are often confused by bright lights and never make it to the sea. And we've only begun to understand the effects. But, fortunately, there are ways to fix it.\n\nThe International Dark Sky Association recommends using shielded lighting, low color temperature LEDs(2700K and less), motion sensors for safety than leaving lights on all night. Unshielded bright LEDs create a lot of glare and impairs vision. Several cities and municipalities have recently switched to dark sky friendly lighting and people are welcoming the change - they’ve hardly noticed any difference in lighting and in fact, hated harsh bright lights. Tucson, Phoenix, Montreal, the state of Georgia are all examples. It makes me really happy and optimistic hearing these success stories. Fighting light pollution does not mean turning all your lights off, it’s about being wise with our lighting choices.\n\nWhat can we do ourselves? Start by inspecting the lighting in our homes. Home Depot has a separate section for dark sky friendly lighting. Then, look for bright unshielded lights on nearby streets, parking lots, etc. Raise awareness on the issue, get help from the IDA to make your city write lighting ordinances. Together, we can fight pollution and have our night skies and our identity back.\n\nContact: srirammurali.com/contact/\nMusic: Imagine by Ryan Taubert\nCopyright All Rights Reserved"
Alien Covenant Sequel Cancelled?

You have talked before about how Netflix won't be hurt to much by Disney taking it's properties off Netflix. But with the Disney/Fox deal it's safe to assume that a similar thing will happen with all the newly acquired Fox properties. Two major company taking content off Netflix is a lot more significant than if just one did. \n\nMelissa Ramirez  - Looks like the sequel to Alien Covenent got cancelled just like you said it would. But really, is it any surprise? The last film did so badly, why did anyone still think a new one would happen?\n\nJacob Hickey - The box office results of Blade Runner 2019 has to rank amongst the biggest cinematic disappointments of 2017. Such a great movie, such a sad result. Ridley Scott is saying that the reason is did badly was the long running time. Do you agree with him?\n\nDion Debord - Hey John. Hope you’re having a great holiday season! With the debate going on about The Last Jedi, Mark Hamill has repeatedly stated his disappointment with the film. My question is, even if all film is subjective, if Luke Skywalker himself says the movie isn’t good, how can anyone still defend it?\n\nIntothefuture - Q: I have been looking forward to the Han Solo film coming out sometime i’m 2018. I thought with Ron Howard coming in that all would be forgiven and or saved? Do you think this movie has a chance? Reports are saying Disney has no faith. This is not good to hear :("

But just as she steps into her role as Mrs. Grey and he relaxes into an unfamiliar stability, new threats could jeopardize their happy ending before it even begins.\n \nAlso returning from prior Fifty Shades entries are Academy Award® winner Marcia Gay Harden, Eric Johnson, Rita Ora, Luke Grimes, Victor Rasuk, Jennifer Ehle, Eloise Mumford, Max Martini, Callum Keith Rennie, Bruce Altman and Robinne Lee, who are joined for the first time by Arielle Kebbel and Brant Daugherty.\n \nFifty Shades Freed is directed by Fifty Shades Darker’s James Foley (Fear, House of Cards) and once again produced by Michael De Luca, Dana Brunetti and Marcus Viscidi, alongside E L James, the creator of the culture-spanning blockbuster series.  The screenplay is by Niall Leonard, based on the novel by James.  www.fiftyshadesmovie.com"

All you do is put the steak on the robot’s food-safe skewers and food probe and it does the rest. We decided to create this robot to cook better steaks using precise temperature measurements throughout the entire cooking process and, most importantly, not have to babysit the grill to achieve this."

Trinitron: Sony's Once Unbeatable Product,Technology Connections,28.0,111825.0,6228.0,180.0,614.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0aFhzGEBQlk/default.jpg,"You can support this channel on Patreon!  Link below\nThroughout much of the analog television era, Sony was the fairly undisputed king of TVs.  Their Trinitron picture tube was a universally well received technology and made a number of important improvements on the standard color picture tube.  This is the story of its creation.\n\n**The trinitron CRT wasn't impervious to Moire patterns.  However, it was less prone to them because of the lack of a phosphor grid.  Vertical misalignment could still occur with the aperture grille, so moire patterns could still appear on patterns with strong vertical stripes.  However, moire patterns wouldn't appear with horizontal image components due to the lack of distinct phosphor groupings.\n\n**The patent expired in 1996, not 1998.\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/technologyconnections\n\nThank you to all my current patrons!\nCharlie Quigley, Tommi Hares, Dakota Williams, Eitan Tal, Brendan Sheehy, Jay Foreman, James Id, Howard Longden, Rich Theobald, Kyle Olson, Bryan Reid, Quinton Wilson, Jeremy DeGuzman, Sean Spark, Lucas Hartbarger, Taylor Cuzela, twiglet, David Lastres, Granger Meador, Jeremy Kitchen, Jason Wellband, Shane Belaire, Paul Emmerich, Sam Hodge, Matthew Rossi, Paul Craigie, Alex Smith, Paul Williams, Ashleigh R, Stephen Bell, voodookidney, Örn Arnarson, Eric Wood, Stephen Pick, Stephen Vrazel, Paul Fisher, BlancoGrande, Matthew Giraitis, James Ryan, Robert Joscelyne, Ellis M.

Watch the OFFICIAL TRAILER for Trust, FX’s new series from Academy Award winners Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy and Christian Colson. Premieres March 25th.\n\nSubscribe now for more Trust clips: http://bit.ly/SubscribeFX \n\nTrust delves into the trials and triumphs of one of America’s wealthiest and unhappiest families, the Gettys. Equal parts family history, dynastic saga and an examination of the corrosive power of money, Trust explores the complexities at the heart of every family, rich or poor.  \n\nTold over multiple seasons and spanning the twentieth century, the series begins in 1973 with the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III (Harris Dickinson), an heir to the Getty oil fortune, by the Italian mafia in Rome. His captors banked on a multi-million-dollar ransom. After all, what rich family wouldn’t pay for the return of a loved one? \nPaul’s grandfather, J. Paul Getty (Donald Sutherland), an enigmatic oil tycoon and possibly the richest man in the world, is marooned in a Tudor mansion in the English countryside surrounded by a harem of mistresses and a pet lion. He’s busy. Paul’s father, J. Paul Getty Jr. (Michael Esper), is lost in a daze in London and refuses to answer the phone. Only Paul’s mother, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), is left to negotiate with the increasingly desperate kidnappers. Unfortunately, she’s broke. Trust charts the teenage grandson’s nightmare ordeal at the hands of kidnappers who cannot understand why nobody seems to want their captive back.\n\nThe cast also includes Brendan Fraser, Anna Chancellor, Norbert Leo Butz, Charlotte Riley and Luca Marinelli.\n\nTrust is created by Simon Beaufoy. Danny Boyle has directed the first three episodes. Executive Producers are Christian Colson, Beaufoy and Boyle. The show is produced by FX Productions, Cloud Eight Films, Decibel Films and Snicket Films Limited.\n\nTrust | Season 1: Official Trailer [HD] | FX\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/FXNetworks"

Sure enough, on the morning of January 2nd I pulled my car up to Nobadeer beach and there they were. This time, two friends surfed just beyond the icy eddie, hooting and hollering and holding up giant icebergs above their heads in neoprene gloved hands. I ran up and down the beach, taking as many shots as I could of this freezing, fleeting show of nature. Slurpee waves are the kind of thing you might only be lucky enough to see once, so I count myself as very lucky to have seen them twice.\n\nFilm & Photos:\nJonathan Nimerfroh\n@jdnphotography\nwww.jdnphotography.com\n\nEdit: KeDa Creative Group\n@kedacreative\nwww.kedacreative.com\n\nMusic: Electronic Pasture by Floyd Kellogg @floydkellogg\nwww.floydkellogg.com\n\nSurfers:\nJamie Briard @soil_surfer\n\nNick Hayden @nickhaydenpercussion\n\nThe Inertia: The Definitive Voice of Surf, Mountain, and Outdoors // http://www.theinertia.com \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/TheInertiaYT\n\nFollow us!\nhttps://twitter.com/the_inertia\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheInertia\nhttp://instagram.com/theinertia\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/theinertia/"

It's hard to explain that feeling when you first hear a song and you immediately fall in love with it. Almost like you've known it all along.\n\nI hadn't even planned to start working on this film yet, but I was so inspired that I furiously began to lay down time-lapse clips. I couldn't stop pouring over it. It was last September and I was supposed to be working on Monsoon IV, but I forgot all about it once I heard Ex Makina's Breathe. It almost felt like it was made for a black and white storm film.\n\nAbout halfway through editing, I knew the song title would be my film title as well. It was so perfect I couldn't believe it. Sometimes for me...when I'm chasing or watching an amazing storm...I'll realize I haven't taken a breath in awhile. Never really thought of it until I heard this song.\n\nI love being inspired by other artists. I love soundtracks. I can't imagine the movie Interstellar without that powerful pipe organ soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. Music is so important to what I do and I'm so incredibly thankful to husband/wife duo Iain and Rebecca Campbell for writing this amazing song. Thanks to the MusicBed as well for having such fantastic musicians and artists.\n\nIn early 2017, I put together a film called Pulse that was my first ever black and white time-lapse movie. It was so different and fun, I wanted to do a follow-up this year before the next chase season begins. Breathe is made up solely of storm clips from 2017...either from the spring across the central plains or from the monsoon here in the southwest. Some are favorites, some are just ones I knew would be amazing in monochrome and others I used because they fit the music so well.  I also went with a wider aspect ratio on these films to give it more of a cinematic feel.\n\nThis is also the first film I've ever done in full 8K resolution. I'm super excited about that. You may not be able to watch it in that resolution, but it's there if you can. Otherwise, 4K is a must if you can!\n\nI truly hope you enjoy this. For me, I needed something to pass the time and bridge the next few months as I wait for supercells to return to the plains. But honestly, I truly love putting these together. Thanks for all your support in the past and feel free to share!\n\nTechnical Details:\n\nI used two Canon 5DSR's along with a Canon 11-24mm, 35mm, 50mm, 135mm and Sigma Art 50mm. Manfrotto tripods. The final product was edited in Lightroom with LR Timelapse, After Effects and Premiere Pro."

No es habitual que un nuevo jugador del FC Barcelona conecte tan pronto con la afición como lo ha hecho Yerry Mina. El defensa ha reunido a un total de 8.552 espectadores en el Camp Nou, muchos de ellos aficionados colombianos que ya conocían al futbolista desde sus inicios en Deportivo Pasto e Independiente Santa Fe. En las gradas ha habido música, bailes y mucha fiesta.\n\nLa presentación ha tenido de todo. Ha arrancado con Yerry Mina descalzándose los zapatos y las medias en un ritual habitual en él antes de pisar el césped y llevar a cabo los habituales toques de balón. Era la primera vez que el central lucía la que será su nueva equipación a partir de ahora, y ha dejado clara su felicidad con un grito apasionado: ¡Vamos, Barça! Visca, Barça!.\n\nA continuación, el jugador ha posado para los medios de comunicación -se han acreditado 103 periodistas, 25 de ellos colombianos, de un total de 70 medios diferentes- y ha completado un rondo con jóvenes jugadores de la cantera. Después el futbolista ha recibido su coche AUDI.\n\nCon cualquier otro jugador la presentación habría acabado segundos más tarde. Pero Yerry Mina se ha acercado hasta el gol para saludar a toda la afición que lo ha venido a recibir. Y allí ha dejado una pequeña pincelada de uno de sus rasgos más característicos: el baile de salsa 'choke' que suele llevar a cabo cada vez que marca un gol. Seguro que volveremos a ver este movimiento en un futuro."

Based on a true story, this poignant, insightful and often funny drama about the healing power of art is adapted from Callahan’s autobiography and directed by two-time Oscar® nominee Gus Van Sant.

So, since we couldn’t find a protein bar we liked, we made our own.  \n\nIntroducing KIND Protein from real food™ - made with premium whole ingredients and a creamy, crunchy texture, it’s a protein bar that doesn’t taste like one. Available in four delicious flavors: Crunchy Peanut Butter, White Chocolate Cinnamon Almond, Toasted Caramel Nut and Double Dark Chocolate Nut."

The main theme of ‘Heroine’ is ‘a flower locked in ice’, describing the earlier story of ‘Gashina’ in which the woman had to accept the sad breakup by saying ‘Why do you leave behind pretty me?’ to herself. This track delicately describes the woman’s frozen heart with SUNMI’s sensibility, who gets hurt by the lopsided relationship with the person she loves but tries to understand the person.   \n \n#SUNMI#선미#Heroine#주인공#Newrelease#MV#1theK#원더케이\n\n▶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\n▶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\n▶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc"

2017 Takes Second Place for Hottest Year,NASA Goddard,28.0,12194.0,244.0,49.0,201.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rgcE2lMa0Kw/default.jpg,"Earth's surface temperatures in 2017 were the second warmest since since 1880, when global estimates first become feasible, NASA scientists found. \nGlobal temperatures 2017 were second only to 2016, which still holds the record for the hottest year; however, 2017 was the warmest year on record that did not start with an El Nino weather pattern, as the previous two years did. \nIn a separate, independent analysis, NOAA scientists found that 2017 was the third-warmest year in their record. The minor difference is due to different methods to analyze global temperatures used by the two agencies, although over the long-term the records remain in strong agreement.

SRAM DUB™ Technology | A Single Solution,SRAM MTB,17.0,53923.0,314.0,55.0,73.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yMl68dEcOAg/default.jpg,"The bicycle industry is almost entirely comprised of enthusiasts and dreamers, but the crew at the San Luis Obispo development facility takes it to a level of intensity that is simply a notch higher. The SLO team operates as a true competitive family—the kind in which you refuse to be one-upped by your sibling, but where you become the world’s loudest cheerleader when your sibling wins. \n\nThis competitive family dynamic is abundantly evident in the SLO group’s newest creation, DUB. This is a product that you don’t see or hear. It’s a product whose measure of success is when you’re not thinking about it. And yet the development team’s excitement for this new product is motivating, even contagious.\n\nTasked with creating a lighter crankset, the engineers here could have easily phoned it in—checked the spreadsheet boxes, so to speak. But this is a group of individuals that attacks Movember as if it were the Mountain Bike World Championships, so ‘just checking the box’ doesn’t really fall into the vernacular. They didn’t want any checked-box product on their bikes, so they made something better. \n\nDUB, as they called it, is a simple solution to an often-tedious problem. DUB is a bottom bracket spindle and bearing design that allows lighter cranksets. DUB allows better bearing seals for better performance over the long term. DUB allows SRAM’s test engineers to perform more focused sets of tests. DUB is forward and backward compatible. DUB makes your life, as a bottom bracket user, easier. \n\nDUB is one more simple solution dreamed up, designed, developed, tested, ridden and loved by a dedicated group of people in San Luis Obispo who live to make better parts for the bicycles they ride."

Primitive Technology: A-frame hut,Primitive Technology,22.0,3702942.0,161760.0,1414.0,13839.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_7985zBEM3o/default.jpg,"I built an A frame hut as a large work space for projects. First I made a celt hatchet to cut timber for the hut. The axe head was made of amphibolite and the handle was made of a species of wattle. For the hut the floor plan was 4 X 4m. The height of the ridgeline was 2 m above the ground. +A post was planted in the ground to support the ridge pole at the back of the structure and an A frame was put in the front to support the ridgeline. The rafters of the hut were then attached to the ridgepole. Palm fronds were then collected, split and lashed to this frame. The dome hut was disassembled and its thatch was added to the structure. Approximately 1200 fronds were used in total. For the ridgeline, thatch was lifted in place and rested on without lashing it down. Instead, pairs of sticks lashed together were lifted in place sitting over thatch preventing it from blowing away. These are known as “jockeys” as they resemble a rider sitting on a horse.\nA wall of wattle and daub was built at the back of the structure. Wooden poles were planted into the ground and lawyer cane was woven between them. Soil was dug from around the hut forming drainage trenches while also supplying the mud used to daub the wall. No fibre was added to the daub, just straight mud. Pegs were stuck into the wall to form a convenient rack to hold the stone axe off the ground when not in use. Later, pegs were added to support the fire sticks too. A bed was made by hammering in wooden stakes and lashing timber to the frame. This was covered with palm fibre to act as bedding. Atherton oak nuts were then collected and eaten/stored in a pot. Latter, heavy rain fell testing the huts ability to shed rain. The hut stayed dry while the water flowed off the thatch and into the drainage trenches left over from digging the mud for the wall.\nThe A frame hut is a simple shelter that can be built quickly and simply. It’s basically a large roof built directly on the ground. The shape is strong and should resist strong winds. This hut is the biggest one I’ve built on this channel and could fit both the tiled roof hut and wattle and daub hut inside it with room left over along the sides. It requires no scaffolding or ladders to build. A person can walk right down the centre without ducking while the sides that are too low to stand in are used for storing firewood, tools and other things. A fire lit in the entrance will greatly reduce the number of mosquitoes in the hut though it will get smokey occasionally. To reduce smoke, a small stove could be built to burn the wood more efficiently. A chimney and fireplace could be built also, but would take more time.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

10 BEST Moments From 2018 SAG Awards,Clevver News,24.0,203431.0,1698.0,412.0,243.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JrFiNSueT3Y/default.jpg,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews\n\nFirst and foremost, our hats go off to Mr. Morgan Freeman also known as the man I hope to narrate my life story one day. He was honored tonight with the Lifetime Achievement Award. \nMorgan’s good friend, Rita Moreno presented him with the prestigious award and the display of their friendship was beyond adorable. Morgan was sure to thank her along with his family and friends who flew out to celebrate with him as well as his peers in the room. Then Morgan took a moment to point out the fact that the SAG award statue, known as the Actor has a bit of a bias to it. \nYou gotta love Morgan Freeman. Another person you can’t help but to love is Sterling K. Brown. He won best male actor in a drama series for his role on This Is Us making history once again becoming the first black man to win in that category. \nSterling also thanked his peers in the room and his beautiful wife who had the sweetest most adorable reaction to his winning streak continuing.  \nWhen the camera panned to Ryan’s face while Sterling was giving his speech, she was literally shaking with pride and happiness. \nWhich brings me to yet another moving moment during the show. Nicole Kidman won her first SAG award tonight for best Female Actor in a television Movie or Limited Series for her work  in Big Little Lies. She got choked up noting that winning means so much to her because she has been acting since she was 14 years old. \nShe went on to thank her co-stars, fellow nominees and female actors who have inspired her and paved the way for her career. \nShe continued saying - We've proven — and these actresses and so many more have proven — we are potent and powerful and viable. I just beg that the industry stays behind us because our stories are finally being told. It's only the beginning.\n\n\nFor More Clevver Visit:\nThere are 2 types of people: those who follow us on Facebook and those who are missing out http://facebook.com/clevver\n\nKeep up with us on Instagram: http://instagr.am/Clevver\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ClevverTV\nWebsite: http://www.clevver.com \n\n\nAdd us to your circles on Google+: http://google.com/+ClevverNews\nTweet Me: http://www.twitter.com/Drew__dorsey"

01/24/2018 - Falcon Heavy Test Fire Finally,Dennis Kapatos,28.0,87209.0,1185.0,22.0,123.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NuXHriwQB9g/default.jpg,"This is a test fire in advance of SpaceX's upcoming Falcon Heavy test launch. The test occurred on 1/24/2018 at Kennedy Space Center's LC-39 Pad A which is the same pad that many Apollo and Space Shuttle launches took place from. SpaceX is currently leasing the pad from NASA. Birds can been seen scattering near the area and the delayed rumble of the 12 second test can also be heard. No date has yet been announced for the test launch. This launch will be the first time SpaceX has launched a vehicle of this configuration and at 140,700 lb to low Earth orbit, it will represent the largest lift capacity of any currently available rocket. Although still short of the 150,000 to 290,000 lb capacity of NASA's upcoming SLS rocket (and well shy of Saturn V's 310,000 lb capacity), this rocket will more than double what is currently available from the Delta IV Heavy."

The Welde family have looked after grizzly bears, black bears and polar bears for the last 91 years – using their license to provide for those in need of a home. But the family tradition came under threat last year when Monica’s husband, Johnny III, died of a heart attack just after he turned 60. But with the help of her son, a devastated Monica has put her loss to one side so she can concentrate on continuing the family legacy and caring for their beloved pet bears.\n\nVideo Credits:\nVideographer / director: Rodrigo Gomez\nProducer: Danny Baggot, Ruby Coote  \nEditor: Sonia Estal \n\nBarcroft TV: https://www.youtube.com/user/barcroftmedia/featured\nBarcroft Animals: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/featured\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured\n\nFor more of the amazing side of life:\n\nFor the full story, visit ANIMALS.BARCROFT.TV: http://animals.barcroft.tv/\nLike @BarcroftAnimals on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BarcroftAnimals/\nFollow @BarcroftAnimals on Twitter: https://twitter.com/BarcroftAnimals\nCheck out more videos: https://www.youtube.com/barcroftanimals/videos\n\nDownload the Barcroft TV iOS app: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/barcroft-tv/id1287734327?mt=8\n\nDownload Barcroft TV on Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.recipe.barcroft&hl=en"

Small Stepper Robot Arm Shuffling Sugar Cubes,Electron Dust,28.0,4610.0,11.0,1.0,6.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1e5vRpODASk/default.jpg,After the last rather badly edited robot-arm-music-video I decided to throw together some of the footage to make a more informative kind of video. In this video I show what this little Arduino/Raspberry Pi powered stepper robot arm with record and play functionality is capable to do.\n\nHere's a blog post about this project:\nhttps://electrondust.com/2018/01/21/small-stepper-robot-arm/\n\nA really quick summary on how it works:\n- The Gripper uses a servo which is controlled by the Raspberry Pi.\n- This robot arm uses 4 cheap geared stepping motors. \n- The motors are powered by 4 A4988 drivers. \n- The drivers are controlled by an Arduino Mega running a modified version of grbl:\nhttps://github.com/dguerizec/grbl-Mega-4axis\n- The Arduino waits for movement commands coming in via serial port.\n- The movement comments are being sent from a Raspberry Pi.\n- The replica arm which is used to control the pose of the arm is mode of 4 potentiometers.\n- The potentiometers are connected to a MCP3006 (this is a A/D converter chip). The chip is connected to the Raspberry pi via SPI.\n- The Raspberry Pi reads all the potentiometer values and sends position commands to the Arduino.\n- Here's the complete code for the Raspberry Pi:\nhttps://github.com/T-Kuhn/StepperRobotArm

In a world ravaged for years by a virus that turns the infected into zombie-like cannibals, a cure is at last found and the wrenching process of reintegrating the survivors back into society begins. Among the formerly afflicted is Senan (Sam Keeley), a young man haunted by the horrific acts he committed while infected. Welcomed back into the family of his widowed sister-in-law (Ellen Page), Senan attempts to restart his life—but is society ready to forgive him and those like him?

The Movie grossed more than $600 million around the world, you are invited to return to the magical Greek island of Kalokairi in an all-new original musical based on the songs of ABBA.  With the film’s original cast returning and new additions including Lily James (Cinderella, Baby Driver), the musical comedy will open on July 20, 2018.\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again is produced by Judy Craymer and Gary Goetzman, producers of the original film.  Craymer is also the creator and producer of the worldwide smash-hit stage musical.  \n\nOl Parker, writer of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, writes and directs the sequel from a story by Catherine Johnson, Richard Curtis and Parker.  Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus return to provide music and lyrics and serve as executive producers.

Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper reunite as Sophie and Sky, while Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård and Oscar® winner Colin Firth return to play Sophie’s three possible dads: Sam, Bill and Harry.\n\nAs the film goes back and forth in time to show how relationships forged in the past resonate in the present, James will play the role of Young Donna.  Filling the roles of Young Rosie and Young Tanya are Alexa Davies (A Brilliant Young Mind) and Jessica Keenan Wynn (Broadway’s Beautiful).  Young Sam will be played by Jeremy Irvine (War Horse), while Young Bill is Josh Dylan (Allied) and Young Harry is Hugh Skinner (Kill Your Friends)."

But prepare yourself for the day after, when you'll almost certainly get a case of DOMS, short for delayed onset muscle soreness. The soreness will persist for about 72 hours, but the good news is you're less likely to get it again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles.\n\nOver the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondria are the parts of your cells that convert carbs, fat, and protein into fuel that your muscles use to do their job, like flex and contract. After six to eight weeks, studies have shown that people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50%. With more mitochondria in your cells, you'll start to feel more fit, and your endurance will increase. So running three miles will no longer feel as difficult as it did during that first week.\n\nOnce you're six months in, all that hard work should finally start to show. If your workouts focus on strength training, you'll notice your muscles begin to take shape. You're also less likely to fall off the workout wagon at this point. Exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months, but after that more people stick with it.\n\nNow, if you're more focused on cardio, then by nine months of regular exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your VO2 max. VO2 max is often used as a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel. Basically, higher VO2 max means you can run faster for longer. So a 25% increase in VO2 max, for example, means you can run about 20% farther in the same amount of time.\n\nAfter one year of regular exercise, your bones will be denser, which reduces your risk of osteoporosis. In fact, researchers have found that regular resistance training, when combined with aerobic exercise, can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months.\n\nNow, if you maintain your exercise program long term, your body might not be the only thing to benefit. Your bank account may also beef up a bit. One study revealed that older people who exercised five days a week for at least 30 minutes saved, on average, $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart-related health problems alone. You'll also be at a lower risk of developing arthritis, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and certain types of cancer like breast and colon.\n\nIn all probability, you're going to live longer than you otherwise would. And that longer life, it will likely feel more fulfilling, because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline.\n\nOf course all these benefits depend on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week. A balanced diet is also paramount to a healthy lifestyle. For the average adult ages 18 to 64, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2 1/2 hours per week of moderately intense exercise, like brisk walking or biking. Or at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high-intensity workouts, like running or swimming sprints.\n\nOn top of that, make sure and take two days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training. This will help your overall speed and endurance. As you begin, it's important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast, or you risk serious injury.\n\nYou'll discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\n\nExercise smart and often, and you'll be running marathons in no time.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Damascus Steel Hand Plane ||| Alec Steele Collab,Dustin Penner,26.0,43564.0,2559.0,31.0,286.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Cy2S6jbviQ/default.jpg,"STOP! First, subscribe to Alec Steele's amazing YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/alectheblacksmith\nCheck out the 3 videos of the plane blade being forged - https://youtu.be/017RX4U5BTI\n\nTHANK YOU TO ROCKLER FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO POSSIBLE!\n                  http://www.rockler.com\n\nLife lesson.  Never say no to Alec Steele.  He asked if I'd be interested in coming up with a collaborative project and my answer was OMG yes!  We decided to make a high angle smoother plane.   Damascus steel blade, hand forged by Alec, and the plane body, sculpted by me.  Originally there were going to be two blades and two planes, but blacksmithing is hard!  One of the blades didn't pass QC so Alec moved ahead with just the single blade. \n\nThis is a high angle smoother plane.  It is made to take thin layers of wood off of lumber to leave a super smooth surface that requires minimal sanding.  This is especially useful for highly figured wood.\n\nSpeaking of highly figured wood, the body of the plane is made out of some amazing curly walnut.  For a little extra flair, I added a paduak racing strip to the right side. The Rockler Bandy Clamps made the glue ups a breeze.\n\nHand planes are devilishly easy to make, but incredibly difficult to make right.  I did a ton of research before getting started to calculate angles, size, shape, and even materials to give myself the best chance of success.  If I someday decide this design doesn't work for me anymore, I can simply build another one.  The blade isn't going anywhere!  All the angled cuts were made on the Rockler Table Saw Sled so I could do them safely and accurately.  This is possibly my number one favourite tool from Rockler.  The sled is perfect.\n\nI roughed out the shape on the bandsaw before sculpting the shape with files, chisels and sandpaper.  The Rockler T-Track Table made this so easy since I was able to flip, rotate and adjust the placement of the plane so I could easily trim wherever I needed to.  Once I was happy with the shape and it fit my hands nicely I sanded for hours.  Every surface was sanded to 400.\n\nTo compliment the paduak stripe I chose a 1/4 copper rod instead of the more traditional brass rod.  I drilled the hole, polished the rod and hammered it home.  Friction is enough to keep it from going anywhere.  The wedge was cut from scrap and sanded to fit perfectly against the blade.  The fit of the wedge is extremly important to how well the plane performs.  \n\nAfter ensureing all parts of the plane work together perfectly I applied 2 coats of danish oil.  It gave the plane a beautiful low luster finish while bringing out the figure of the wood perfectly.  After a few weeks I will come back and give it a light waxing.  \n\nI think thats everything... Be sure to check out the 3 videos Alec made showing how the plane blade was forged.  It's incredible to watch and Alec's energy is infectious.  You will just be happy after watching.  Also a big thank you to Rockler for supporting not only me, but so many makers around the world.  \n\n===========================================\n- Instagram - http://instagram.com/dpmakestuff\n- Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/dpmakestuff\n- Plans - http://www.dpmakestuff.com\n\n===========================================\n= Links To Tools Used =\n\nTape Cutter:  http://amzn.to/2wExKdG\nTable Saw Sled: http://shrsl.com/r87s\nBandy Clamps: http://shrsl.com/r87v\nT-Track Table: http://shrsl.com/r88e\nFlexcut Chisels: http://shrsl.com/r88f\nSilicon Mat: http://amzn.to/2FldFL4\nGlue Brush: http://amzn.to/2EgCgBp\nDanish Oil: http://amzn.to/2EdW3kW\nWooden Mallet:  http://amzn.to/2gLRJ4I\nRuler:  http://amzn.to/2bOARY4\nTitebond Glue:  http://amzn.to/1TmiBAs\nChisels:  http://amzn.to/2w5fKpm\nForstner Drill Bits:  http://amzn.to/2bRDTMk\nF Clamps:  http://amzn.to/2gL4lJy\n\n===========================================\n\n= Bookmark these to support the channel =\n- Amazon - http://amzn.to/2ezs5zq\n- Amazon Canada - http://amzn.to/2vVrz1m\n\n===========================================\n\n= Shop Equipment =\nRockler Stuff:  http://amzn.to/2bYUGJf\nSaw Stop:  http://amzn.to/2ctLWdP\nBand Saw:  http://amzn.to/2c72OZN\nLathe:  http://amzn.to/2e9IjMN\nX Carve CNC:  https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve\n\n===========================================\nFeeling like sending me a letter, stickers or crisp 100 dollar bill?

It was actually his first ever time performing at the annual awards ceremony and let’s just say he did not disappoint. Looking handsome as ever in an all white suit, he absolutely crushed the performance of his stand-alone track ‘Terrified,’ off his nominated album ‘Awaken, My Love.’\nNot only did he melt our hearts with that voice, he then completely surprised us by bringing JD McCrary up on stage to sing with him. Who, also sung like an actual angel.\nTonight felt like a preview of what’s to come, since Donald Glover and JD will actually be starring in a movie together, as they both are set to be in the Live-Action Lion King film.  JD will be voicing Young Simba and Donald will be voicing older Simba. And after this performance, we completely understand the casting choice.  \nThis was definitely a big night for Childish Gambino. In case that performance wasn’t enough, his track ‘Redbone’ just won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\nBut right now I wanna turn it over to you guys. What did you think of Childish Gambino’s performance?

But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.\n\nComing off the most successful film in the series, The Purge: Election Year, creator James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year) returns alongside the producers of this worldwide phenomenon: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious series, Get Out, Split), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).  \n\nThe First Purge is directed by Gerard McMurray (Burning Sands), working from a screenplay once again written by DeMonaco.  www.thefirstpurge.com"

How This Frugal Family of 4 Paid Off $96k in Debt & Built a Custom Tiny House,Exploring Alternatives,26.0,109455.0,4448.0,58.0,379.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GQ6cKZ3Zf9A/default.jpg,"After finishing school, Jocelyn and Jarvis had $96,000 of debt from student loans, credit cards, and buying a small rural property.  This is the story of how they paid it off in just 20 months, and then built themselves a debt-free custom tiny house for their family of 4.\n\nAfter ignoring their finances for a long time, the couple finally faced reality one night when they sat down and added up all of their debts, and compared it to the revenue they had coming in.\n\nWhen they realized how much they owed, they decided to make some drastic changes so they could pay it off and stop worrying about money.\n\nTo start, they moved to a smaller apartment, changed jobs, shopped second-hand, froze a credit card in a block of ice, switched to using cash only, and made a budget that allowed them to chip away at their debt.\n\nThey had a white board with a list of all their debts, which they updated every time a payment was made so they'd continue to be motivated.  After 20 months, they were completely debt-free.  After that, they continued with their minimalist, frugal habits and were able to save up enough money to build themselves a custom tiny house on wheels.\n\nThey've been living in the tiny house for over two years now, with their two children, and plan to continue living in it for as long as they can.  They are currently saving money to buy a small acreage where they will build a larger off grid home and keep the tiny house as an income property.\n\nWe're very inspired by this young family's dedication to improve their lives by paying off their debt, by their awareness of their energy consumption, by their efforts to buy less and live a low waste lifestyle.\n\nThey're trying to make positive change in every aspect of their lives, and that's not always an easy thing to do.  \n\nThank you, Jocelyn and Jarvis, for sharing your story with us!

SpaceX will launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a 4200 KG satellite called GovSat-1/SES-16 to Geostationary Transfer Orbit. This satellite serves the Luxembourg Government and a commercial customer SES. This is the 2nd flight of this particular Falcon 9 1st stage, having first flown last year for the NROL-76 mission, but it will be its last. \n\nDespite having plenty of fuel to land, they will be letting this one touch down softly in the ocean after its primary mission is over. This is because SpaceX has so many of these current block 3 boosters around which are not meant for long term reuse, and they require too much refurbishment to reuse them more than once, AND the drone ship needs to be ready for Falcon Heavy's center core next week. \n\nThis is the third time SES has opted to fly on a previously flown booster, they were the first customers to do so March, 2017 with mission SES-10. This is the 6th reuse of a booster for SpaceX. This is the 29th launch from SpaceX's launch pad, SLC-40, and the 48th over all launch of the Falcon 9. \n\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\n\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\n\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\n\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/"

Why isn’t ‘Off to the Vet’ available in full on YouTube? A. ‘Off to the Vet’ film production and crowdfunding campaign was a huge undertaking for the Simon’s Cat Team. Our hope is to produce more long form, full colour content for our fans but without having to turn to them through crowdfunding again. The film was completed in 2015 and submitted it to a selection of international film festivals over the following months. During this time, it was exclusively available to all funders that contributed via our private production blog. The feedback we have received from our funders has been overwhelming positive and we hope they are extremely proud of making the film a possibility. If you are a funder and have any questions regarding the campaign, please contact us at igg@simonscat.com\n\nQ. What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Even though the films are made on computer software, they are still hand-animated in a traditional manner, frame to frame. It usually takes between 12 and 25 drawings to create 1 second of a Simon's Cat film.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official web shop: \nhttp://www.shop.simonscat.com"

That speech is used to reflect on the progress of the previous year and help set the president’s agenda for the coming year.\n\nThis is Trump's first official State of the Union Address. The speech Trump gave last year to a joint session of Congress was not called the State of the Union. A president’s address during his or her first year in office is never referred to as a State of the Union address because after just a few weeks into his term, a new president isn’t expected to know the full state of the union."

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before. Welcome to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. \n\nStars Pratt and Howard return alongside executive producers Steven Spielberg and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. They are joined by co-stars James Cromwell, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Geraldine Chaplin, Daniella Pineda, Toby Jones, Rafe Spall and Isabella Sermon, while BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles. \n\nDirected by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible), the epic action-adventure is written by Jurassic World’s director, Trevorrow, and its co-writer, Derek Connolly. Producers Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley once again partner with Spielberg and Trevorrow in leading the filmmakers for this stunning installment. Belén Atienza joins the team as a producer."

The Falcon Heavy is a monster. \n\nIt has 27 engines, can generate more power than 18 747 jumbo jets, and is the most powerful rocket to fly since NASA's moon rocket, the Saturn V.\n\nMaking it the most powerful functioning rocket on Earth. This is one of SpaceX's most difficult launches. Musk even said Just bear in mind that there is a good chance this monster rocket blows up.\n\nBut it didn't!\n\nEven though this was a test launch, Musk took the opportunity to send some payload to space. A Tesla Roadster, which will eventually reach Mars' orbit.\n\nNow, that's a rocket test like we've never seen before. Afterward, SpaceX retrieved each of the 3 boosters for possible reuse. They landed one booster on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean and 2 at its landing base in Florida.\n\nMusk has said the Falcon Heavy could usher people to Mars someday in the future. That day now looks closer than ever. And who knows?\n\nMaybe a Roadster will be waiting when they get there.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Host Sara Gilbert gets emotional, reading a statement filed against Baio by their co-star Alexander Polinsky, He's a dear friend of mine, Gilbert shares, before she continues reading the statement about Baio acting 'inappropriately' to Eggert on set during the first season, calling him 'various homophobic slurs,' 'I received regular verbal attacks, mental abuse and I also suffered a physical assault at the hands of Scott Baio.' Gilbert asks Eggert, Alexander says he witnessed this the first year of the show, which would make you 14? Eggert responds, 14-years-old, 1986 and before I was 15-years-old, he had me at his home, in his car, in his garage and he penetrated my vagina with his finger and this is where it began and this continued almost on a weekly basis for years. Of course, the abuse progressed from there quite a bit although I remained a virgin until I was 17.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow “The Talk” on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow “The Talk” on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

While Britain created the immortal Spitfire, Lancaster and Edgley Optica, it also created a wealth of dangerous, disgraceful and diabolical designs. These are just ten plucked from a shortlist of thirty.  In defining ‘worst’- we’ve looked for one, or a combination, of the following: design flaws, conceptual mistakes, being extremely dangerous, being unpleasant to fly, or obsolete at the point of service entry (and the type must have entered service). Grab a cup of tea, and prepare for ire as you read about ten machines they wanted your dad, grandad or great grandad to fly to war. I'd love to hear your opinions below.

Like a dome or arch, the support comes from the sides rather than the top, and the water underneath prevents the ice from breaking. But, experience and careful advance planning are key. Factors including temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even satellite images of the Earth’s surface are considered. It’s complicated, but appealing to mathematicians like Ajne. Even with preparation, there’s a risk of falling in… So it’s best done in groups, for safety.\n\nRead about the science behind Nordic skating in How Skating on Thin Ice Creates Laser-Like Sounds\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/activities/winter-sports/skating-thin-black-ice-creates-sound-nordic-spd/\n\nHear the Otherworldly Sounds of Skating on Thin Ice | National Geographic \nhttps://youtu.be/v3O9vNi-dkA\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

Why Is Caviar So Expensive?,Tech Insider,28.0,517464.0,7679.0,231.0,814.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5_O5bT3hfkQ/default.jpg,"Caviar is one of the most expensive foods in the world. Selling for up to $35,000 per kilo, it's revered and relished by aristocrats across the globe. But it's an acquired taste. Turns out, caviar wasn't always so valuable. In the 19th century, sturgeon species in the US were so common that there are accounts of caviar being offered in saloons for free, like bar nuts. In Europe, fishermen were feeding the eggs to their pigs, or leaving it on the beach to spoil. What changed?\n\nSimilar to true champagne, caviar doesn't come from just anywhere. This, for example, is not caviar. To get the real thing, it has to be eggs from a sturgeon. There are 27 species around the world in North America, Europe, and Asia. But probably not for long. \n\nArne Ludwig: In this case, sturgeon will die out because humans are over-harvesting their populations and destroying their habitats.\n\nIn 2010, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed 18 species on its Red List of Threatened Species, making the sturgeon the most endangered group of species on Earth. But lists like these are bittersweet. On the one hand, they can help protect the sturgeon from further population decline. On the other hand, the rarer that caviar becomes, the more we can't get enough of it. There's actually an economic idea that explains this. It's called the rarity value thesis and it describes how rarity increases the value of the item. Sturgeon can weigh up to several thousand pounds, and produce hundreds of pounds of roe at a time. The world record belongs to a beluga sturgeon that weighed 2,520 pounds and yielded 900 pounds of roe. Today, she'd be worth about half a million dollars. \n\nIt wasn't until around the 20th century when these freshwater fish and their eggs became a rare commodity. Pollution poisoned their waters and dams blocked their spawning grounds upstream. They had nowhere to reproduce and continued to be overfished for their meat and roe. On top of that, it takes 8-20 years for a female to sexually mature, depending on the species. She can produce millions of eggs at a time, but odds are that only one will survive to adulthood. In the end, the sturgeon population couldn't keep up with demand and their coveted eggs became the jewels of the luxury food scene. Today, caviar imports and exports are closely regulated in the US., which is partly why it's so expensive. \n\nDeborah Keane: People forget that every single egg, every one of these eggs is taken off by hand. Now, remember that we're dealing with a raw seafood endangered species. So it is basically like eating and dealing with edible elephant tusks. It is that heavily regulated.\n\nThat's why today, the majority of caviar comes from sturgeon farms.\n\nDeborah Keane: Little did I know that by 2011, all wild caviar would become illegal on the planet. When I started there were six farms in the world and only two producing caviar in the world and that was in 2004. Now, there are 2,000 farms.\n\nOne farm, in particular, in China called Kaluga Queen produces 35% of the world's caviar. Caviar there is harvested with the classic Russian and Iranian technique, which involves killing the fish and then extracting the eggs. Other farms are exploring a different technique, which doesn't involve killing the fish. It's called stripping. The fish are injected with a hormone that triggers their urge to release eggs. Farmers have been doing this for many years, but not to get caviar — just to produce more fish. It wasn't until recently that people started canning this stuff and selling it as caviar.\n\nDmitrijs Tracuks: The biggest thing is that yes, fish stays alive. You have really small impact on the fish because you do it really fast. You take the fish out of the water, you put it on the special holding facility. The fish has already started to spawn and so all that requires is to press on the belly, massage the belly and the caviar will just flow out of the fish.\n\nThe idea behind no-kill caviar is a commendable one, but it has yet to catch on. Either way, with caviar farms in place, this gives the wild sturgeon population a chance to recover. But whether or not, that happens is largely up to us.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

It makes tiny, artificial earthquakes: here's why.\n\nThanks to all the team at Wiechert'sche Erdbebenwarte Göttingen! You can find out more about them here: https://www.erdbebenwarte.de/\n\nThree things I had to cut out of this video, because they didn't quite fit into the story or because I couldn't film them:\n\nThe reason the steel ball survived two world wars is because the university's records listed it by use as a rock-ball, not by composition as a steel ball - so no-one melted it down for weaponry.\n\nThe observatory team refill that pit every year to make the ground flat, and the ball just digs a hole again. The rock's just being compressed underneath. They joke that, somewhere in Australia, there's a slowly growing hill...\n\nAnd finally, the ground steams for a little while after the ball hits: it gets rather warm...\n\nEdited by Michelle Martin (@mrsmmartin)\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

So then she says to me, 'What's the matter with you, you gay?' After that, for weeks on end, she was the most abusive homophobic, person I've ever met in my entire life..the absolutely last person you that you should ever allow, in my opinion, into the White House. About her recent revelations from her time in the administration, he says, The only thing she is less likely to get into bed with than me, is the truth...when she was in the White House, apparently, very divisive, causing trouble all the time, backstabbing people, achieving nothing..to me, it was a shocking lack of judgement by Donald Trump...Mr. Trump, you're supposed to be a winner.

5 Ways To Use The Last Bit Of Everything,BuzzFeed Nifty,26.0,217232.0,4504.0,129.0,106.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zFYFHQq6dgs/default.jpg,"Get your life together with the Nifty Organization Journal: bit.ly/2AYkXm2\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\n5 Ways To Use The Last Bit Of Everything\n \nDIY Tinted Lip Balm\n\nMATERIALS\nShea butter\nCocoa butter\nLipstick\nLip balm container\nBeauty Spatula\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nWith the help of a beauty spatula, remove excess lipstick from the inside of a lipstick tube. \nUsing a double boiler, melt the lipstick and add two parts shea butter and one part cocoa butter. We used 2 teaspoons of shea butter and 1 teaspoon of cocoa butter. Mix. \nTip: Use less shea butter and cocoa butter for a more pigmented lip balm, and more shea butter and cocoa butter for a more subtle tinted lip balm. \nPour the mixture into a container and let it sit to cool. \nUse like a regular lip balm. \n\n\nCandle Melts\n\nMATERIALS\nTweezers\nAlmost empty candle jars\nSilicone mold\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPlace your candle jar into a pot filled with hot water (with the water line not passing the middle of the jar) and allow the wax to melt completely. \nRemove any wicks with a pair of tweezers. \nCarefully remove the candle jar from the hot water and pour the melted wax into the silicone mold. \nLet the candle wax harden completely. \nEnjoy by using in a candle warmer. \n\n\nMustard Salad Dressing\n\nMATERIALS\nAlmost empty mustard bottle\nHoney\nOlive oil\nApple cider vinegar\nSalt \nPepper\n\n \nINSTRUCTIONS \nIf you’re having trouble getting use out of the mustard at the bottom of the bottle, this is perfect for you! Open the top of the bottle and pour in the ingredients necessary to make a delicious salad dressing. We went for a basic mustard vinaigrette using honey (to taste), 3 parts olive oil, one part apple cider vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. \nOptional: Add other herbs for extra flavor. \nSeal the bottle back up and shake it to mix the ingredients. The bottle itself will act as a perfect container to pour out the dressing. Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 months. \n\n\nScented Epsom Salt\n\nMATERIALS\nEpsom salt\nEmpty essential oil bottle\nTweezers\nContainer (that fits the epsom salt) \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPour epsom salt into a resealable container. \nOpen up the bottle of essential oil and separate its parts as necessary. \nPlace the pieces of the essential oil bottle inside the epsom salt, with the salt completely covering the parts of the bottle. Close the container and give it a shake. \nLeave for 24 hours. \nAll of the essential oil residue that was left inside the empty bottle will have been absorbed by the epsom salt, leaving behind a deliciously scented epsom salt. \n\n\nNail Polish Marbling\n\nMATERIALS\nPlastic container\nNail polish\nPointed stirring stick or wooden skewer\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nFill your plastic container approximately halfway with warm water. \nSwirl nail polish over it, use your stick to create a design. Work quickly to ensure that the nail polish doesn’t get too tacky (this makes marbling more difficult). \nSlowly press the object that you would like to marble into the nail polish, and carefully flip it out to keep the nail polish from sliding off of the surface. Let it dry completely before using, and enjoy! \nOptional: Apply a sealant over the nail polish to make the design permanent. \n\n\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/47724\n\n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Audio Network"

How Much Will Black Panther Boost Avengers Infinity War Box Office,John Campea,24.0,28616.0,1046.0,47.0,481.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dAfqL3Hts_U/default.jpg,"On this episode of The John Campea Show (Recorded Monday, February 19th 2018) John discusses the following viewer submitted topics:\n\nSupport John on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/johncampea\n\nTyler Roberts - With Black Panther smashing this weekend i think Infinity War is going to get dangerously close to beating the force awakens opening. People are also underestimating The Guardians of the Galaxy and the pop that will bring to IW since a lot of people didn’t know they are even apart of the avengers. Thoughts?\n\nRaymundo Lopez - Black Panther is now the MCU’s highest opening weekend for a stand alone movie. Do you think this gives confidence to Marvel that the MCU can survive and thrive once the original cast leaves? Do you also think this puts to rest the talks that the MCU needs to reboot after Thanos?\n\nJosh DeRose - After numerous false starts, it appears as though NBC might finally be moving forward with a companion series for The Office. Assuming John Krasinski reprises his role, do you believe the show will live up to fan expectations?"

For the past 5 weeks, I've been working in the ICU, facing so much death and so many grieving families... at times it has been incredibly difficult. There often isn't time to process your emotions during the day while you are working and these experiences can build up.\n\nThe question becomes: how do you process these experiences in a healthy way? I believe this happens on many levels. \nFirst is at the level of the team, with debriefing and discussions. In the ICU we actually do some formal sessions after challenging codes (when a patient's heart stops or they stop breathing) with all the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and students. \nThen it's important to figure out what works best for you - do you process thoughts through journaling? exercising? blogging? \nPersonally I find talking to trusted friends, family and colleagues is the best way for me to process my thoughts and emotions.\n\nI want this video to remind you to TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF and to LOOK OUT FOR OTHERS who may be struggling! We all experience highs and lows in life. \n\nThank you so much for watching! I know this was a heavy topic and different than my usual vlogs in hospital. I believe it's a crucial topic and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\nCOMMENT BELOW - I am really looking forward to having a conversation with you guys and hearing your thoughts!\n\nSUBSCRIBE to experience more of my journey as a junior doctor! \n\n~ Siobhan (aka Violin MD) ~\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n♫ Background Music ♫ \n\nRhodesia by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/\n\nBrahms Symphony No. 3 - Scherzo"

Change out the towel each time the towel gets damp to make your lettuce last longer.\nStore milk sideways so the liquid covers the inside of the lid, creating a seal to prevent bacteria.\nInsert a piece of parchment paper between each slice of bread before freezing. This will extend your bread’s life and prevent them from sticking to each other in the cold.\nFreeze unused butter until you need them to slow down the expiration date.\nPut onions in a clean pair of tights, tying a small knot between each onion. This will keep onion lasting longer.\nPut excess flour in an airtight container and freeze until needed. Make sure to let it come to room temperature before use.\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/48920\n\n\nMUSIC\nSFX Provided By AudioBlocks\n(https://www.audioblocks.com)"

Such shelves are important because they hold back a vast amount of ice. If all such West Antarctic shelves were to collapse and spill the ice into the ocean then global sea level would rise by 10 feet. Beneath the Ross Ice Shelf is one of the least explored bits of ocean on Earth. New Zealand scientists used a hot-water drill hose to create a hole through the thick ice until they reached the perpetually dark water. They hoped to study the health and history of the shelf. Their findings surprised them. They found that the ice in the hole itself and along the base of the shelf was crystalizing and freezing rather than melting. Measurements will be taken for the next few years, to see how the Ross Ice Shelf is changing over time.\n\nRead more in Deep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected\n\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/ross-ice-shelf-bore-antarctica-freezing/\n\nDeep Bore Into Antarctica Finds Freezing Ice, Not Melting as Expected | National Geographic\nhttps://youtu.be/fyjt5zpNAeg\n\nNational Geographic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/natgeo"

Would love to hear your reasoning as to why or why not.\n\nDedra Simpson - I’ve seen you talk about both MoviePass and Sinemia so I was wondering if you’ve seen the story that MoviePass is suing Sinemia. I know you use both so I wanted to know what you thought about it and does it change the way you think about either company?\n\nNathan Zapata - Today in the mail I received a flyer for Cinemark's movie-lover membership. For only $8.99 a month you get a movie ticket a day, 20% off concessions and you can share with a friend. With all of the controversy regarding movie pass and AMC. Do you see other theater chains creating their own movie pass like deal?"

And yet even after West Virginia University discovered the corruption, VW wouldn't announce that the defeat device worked until it had been proven again through testing by the California Air Resources Board. It's a reminder that we all need to be better, do better, and do the right thing. \n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!"

I like faster/louder triggers and roleplays, so I realized that I don't tend to slow it down in many of my videos. This video is the opposite! Let's explore some triggers slowly and gently, with soft whispers ear to ear. :) I hope you enjoy!\n\nTimestamps:\nIntro 0:00\nCork Candle 2:25 \nSoft Bristle Brush 7:52\nTiny Lotion Jar 15:14\nKeyboard 21:50\nOutro 28:30\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy upload schedule:\n►Every Tuesday\n►Every Thursday\n►Every Saturday\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(💖☀️Seeking Therapy or Counseling? Try online.)\nhttp://www.tryonlinetherapy.com/gibiasmr/ \n\nI find that I get a lot of comments and messages about using ASMR for anxiety, depression, and more. I can totally relate with that, and ASMR is an awesome outlet for those things. However, if you’re interested, above is a link to a website with real, professional & licensed counselors. You can type to them, or call them! It’s actually a really cool service and I use it personally. It costs as low as $35 a week, and you don’t have to leave your house to use it. :)\n\n\nFTC: By using my BetterHelp referral link you are supporting this channel.

It seemed like a really clever idea - but it was really hard to research.

But there's still a question: why is being used to mark an undersea cable, instead of guiding people home?\n\n(Full disclosure: there were some weird strobing effects from the light that only showed up when I got the footage into the edit, so the image you see here has been digitally stabilised so it appears the same way on screen as it does in person!)\n\nThanks to Andrew Stine for suggesting this!\n\nReferences:\nThe original Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern\nThe patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US4629325\nThe US military analysis [PDF]: http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a168108.pdf\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

That sequel is finally here and when they asked me to provide a title song once more I couldn't refuse.

Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA.

Primitive Technology: Lime,Primitive Technology,22.0,2947593.0,109413.0,1358.0,9534.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ek3aeUhHaFY/default.jpg,"At the old hut site (the new one being temporarily cut off by flooding) I made lime mortar from the shells of rainforest snails by firing them in a kiln, slaking them in water, mixing them into lime putty. Limestone is basically calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The general source of lime is limestone and various other calcareous minerals, though shells, egg shells and coral are other sources of lime (for more information see video on Corporals Corner channel: https://youtu.be/tOhAfaFboNU). When heated above 840 degrees Celsius, the lime decomposes into calcium oxide (CaO) or Quicklime and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). When water is added to the quicklime it becomes calcium hydroxide Ca (OH)2 or lime putty. From here the calcium hydroxide can then be shaped into a form and allowed to set. Carbon dioxide enters the lime putty as it dries causing it to turn back into calcium carbonate. The new calcium carbonate has then set, remaining solid and water resistant. \nIn my local geography, calcareous rocks such as limestone are absent leading to a difficulty in acquiring the feed stock for lime making. However, I was still able to make lime by collecting the shells of large terrestrial snails that are native to the rainforest here. The unoccupied shells of these snails were gathered up and stored at the hut. Fire wood was gathered and packed neatly into the kiln. Importantly, the firewood was stacked on top of the grate rather than underneath it in the firebox as is the normal procedure for firing pottery. Using an ordinary updraft pottery kiln in this configuration allows it to reach much higher temperatures than would be possible during normal use. The wood was lit from above and the fire burned down towards the grate. Alternate layers of shells and wood were added on to this burning fuel bed. After adding the last layer of wood to act as a “lid” to prevent heat loss from above I left the kiln to finish on its own, unsupervised. The whole process took about an hour and a half.\nWhen the kiln had cooled down a few hours later, I took out the calcined shells. Not shown in the video was the fact that some shells got so hot, the dirt stuck to them turned into slag and fused to them, possibly with the lime acting a flux lowering its melting point. This extreme heat (+1200 c) should be avoided as the over burnt lime becomes “dead lime”, unable to slake in water. Most shells were still useable though. They were taken out of the kiln and had water added to them. An exothermic reaction then ensued. Heat was produced as the lime quicklime turned into slaked lime. The water heated up creating steam and the shells decomposed into a white paste. The paste was stirred and crushed pottery was added to it as an aggregate (sand is normally used for this, I just had a lot of old pot sherds lying about to dispose of). This lime mortar mixture was then formed into a block shape and left to dry. It took about a week and a half to set as we have had extremely humid, wet weather. The block was observed to have set demonstrating its properties.\nWhat I created is actually lime mortar, typically used for mortaring bricks and tiles together. It’s basically the ‘Glue’ that holds together the building blocks of masonry structures. From my research 20 kg of lime mortar is used on a 1 m square section of brick wall. 5 kg of lime to 15 kg of aggregate (sand, grog etc.) per a 1 m square section of bricks. The shells, though large, are not terribly abundant. A method for finding shells efficiently needs to be made before considering making lime mortar in this fashion. From my experience sand bars in a creek sometimes accumulate snail shells from higher up in the mountains. In these spots, water velocity decreases and shells in the water tend to drop out of the water column. Additionally lime may be partially replaced with ordinary wood ash in mortar without a corresponding decrease in strength. To conclude, making lime in a land without limestone is possible but can be problematic when trying to do so on a large scale.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.\n\nHelping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series."

Other than that brief period on Game of Thrones when she dyed her hair black, the lady of Winterfell never strays from her signature red color. But the actress that plays her, Sophie Turner, is far more experimental. She's dyed her hair from blonde to red and back again more times than she'd like to recall. Turner's also been the face of haircare brand Wella Professionals since June 2017, so it's safe to say she knows a thing or two about good hair.\nOf all the hairstyles on Game of Thrones, braids reign supreme. To test her knowledge, we asked Turner to look at a series of hairstyles and guess whether they were from Westeros or the runway. \n\nSubscribe to Harper's Bazaar: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoBAZAAR\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar\nhttps://twitter.com/harpersbazaarus\nhttps://www.instagram.com/harpersbazaarus/\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/harpersbazaar/?auto_follow=1"

Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.\n\nHelping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie. Emmy® Award-winning host and producer Ryan Seacrest will return as host of the beloved series."

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/"

Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.\n\nHelping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.

How Ticks Dig In With a Mouth Full of Hooks | Deep Look,Deep Look,28.0,432987.0,6751.0,193.0,1142.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_IoOJu2_FKE/default.jpg,"Why can't you just flick a tick? Because it attaches to you with a mouth covered in hooks, while it fattens up on your blood. For days. But don't worry – there *is* a way to pull it out.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Deep Look! http://goo.gl/8NwXqt \n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world.  Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small. \n\nSpring is here. Unfortunately for hikers and picnickers out enjoying the warmer weather, the new season is prime time for ticks, which can transmit bacteria that cause Lyme disease. \n\nHow they latch on – and stay on – is a feat of engineering that scientists have been piecing together. Once you know how a tick’s mouth works, you understand why it’s impossible to simply flick a tick. \n\nThe key to their success is a menacing mouth covered in hooks that they use to get under the surface of our skin and attach themselves for several days while they fatten up on our blood.\n\n“Ticks have a lovely, evolved mouth part for doing exactly what they need to do, which is extended feeding,” said Kerry Padgett, supervising public health biologist at the California Department of Public Health in Richmond. “They're not like a mosquito that can just put their mouth parts in and out nicely, like a hypodermic needle.”\n\nInstead, a tick digs in using two sets of hooks. Each set looks like a hand with three hooked fingers. The hooks dig in and wriggle into the skin. Then these “hands” bend in unison to perform approximately half-a-dozen breaststrokes that pull skin out of the way so the tick can push in a long stubby part called the hypostome.\n\n“It’s almost like swimming into the skin,” said Dania Richter, a biologist at the Technische Universität in Braunschweig, Germany, who has studied the mechanism closely. “By bending the hooks it’s engaging the skin. It’s pulling the skin when it retracts.”\n\nThe bottom of their long hypostome is also covered in rows of hooks that give it the look of a chainsaw. Those hooks act like mini-harpoons, anchoring the tick to us for the long haul.\n\n“They’re teeth that are backwards facing, similar to one of those gates you would drive over but you're not allowed to back up or else you'd puncture your tires,” said Padgett.\n\n--- How to remove a tick.\nKerry Padgett, at the California Department of Public Health, recommends grabbing the tick close to the skin using a pair of fine tweezers and simply pulling straight up.\n\n“No twisting or jerking,” she said. “Use a smooth motion pulling up.”\n\nPadgett warned against using other strategies.    \n\n“Don't use Vaseline or try to burn the tick or use a cotton swab soaked in soft soap or any of these other techniques that might take a little longer or might not work at all,” she said. “You really want to remove the tick as soon as possible.”\n\n---  What happens if the mouth of a tick breaks off in your skin?\nDon’t worry if the tick’s mouth parts stay behind when you pull. \n\n“The mouth parts are not going to transmit disease to people,” said Padgett. \n\nIf the mouth stayed behind in your skin, it will eventually work its way out, sort of like a splinter does, she said. Clean the bite area with soap and water and apply antibiotic ointment.\n\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science: https://www.kqed.org/science/1920972/how-ticks-dig-in-with-a-mouth-full-of-hooks\n\n---+ For more information: \nCenters for Disease Control information on Lyme disease:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/lyme/\n\nMosquito & Vector Control District for San Mateo County, California:\nhttps://www.smcmvcd.org/ticks\n\n\n---+ More Great Deep Look episodes: \n\nHow Mosquitoes Use Six Needles to Suck Your Blood\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD8SmacBUcU\n\nSo … Sometimes Fireflies Eat Other Fireflies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWdCMFvgFbo\n\nMeet the Dust Mites, Tiny Roommates That Feast On Your Skin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACrLMtPyRM0\n\n\n---+ See some great videos and documentaries from the PBS Digital Studios! \n\nAbove the Noise: Are Energy Drinks Really that Bad?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l0cjsZS-eM\n\nIt’s Okay To Be Smart: Inside an ICE CAVE! - Nature's Most Beautiful Blue\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LKm9jtm8I\n\n\n---+ Follow KQED Science: \nKQED Science: http://www.kqed.org/science \nTumblr: http://kqedscience.tumblr.com \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/kqedscience \n\n---+ About KQED \nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media. \n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. \n\nThe house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym.\n\nThe driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. \n\nA huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji.\n\nAt the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. \n\nZedd also has a server room and a Costco Room that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time.\n\nThe bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning.\n\nThe remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house.\n\nOutside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops.\n\nThe kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.  \n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Architectural Digest on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/2zl7s34\n\nABOUT ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST\nThe leading international design authority, Architectural Digest features articles and videos of the best in architecture, style, culture, travel, and shopping.\n\nInside Zedd's $16 Million Mansion That Has a Skittles Machine | Open Door | Architectural Digest"

We’ve talked about collaborating since then. \n\nDon: When I met Ansel I knew he was a very talented actor but when I first heard him sing he totally blew my mind.\n\nAnsel: ‘Believe’ started as an instrumental that Don sent me in late 2015 I always loved it but wasn’t sure what to write to it that would be as epic as Don’s production.  \n\nDon: It took a while for us to finish the record but we wanted it to be something we both truly loved. \n\nAnsel: I was inspired by Freddie Mercury’s epic song writing, something that could be an arena anthem but also holds deeper meaning.”\n\nDon: After Ansel's vocals were recorded I got so inspired I ended up lifting the instrumental itself as well and I feel we both delivered a song that we can be proud of for the years to come. \n\nLyrics:\nPromises promises, year after year on my knees\nParadise knocks for my future, just have to believe\nFlood flood flood in the streets so they said\nBlood blood blood in the streets of my head\n\nDo you believe in me\nDo you believe in me\nWe believed in you\nWe believed in you\n\nJust listen to Father and he’ll set you up to seek seeds \nIn the soil to dry to produce what we \nNeed for our family trees\nCutting down to our knees\nWe look up to the sky to retell the old \nStories of glorious, battles victorious\nBrothers notorious, empires turn to dust\nMen turned delirious, reasons mysterious\nDestruction comes near to us, our mothers shed tears for us\n\nDo you believe in me\nDo you believe in me\nWe believed in you\nWe believed in you\n\nLived on my knees\nThey told me that you’d set me free\nWe lost our years together because of the fear\nKnow i’m never gonna make it there\nI just wanted Eden on repeated sunny days\nThe land below me cracks and tears\nLook into the sky through the thick and rainy haze\n\nDo you believe in me\nDo you believe in me\nWe believed in you\nWe believed in you\n\nAnimation: Erik Middendorp for HEXAGON FILM\nExecutive Producer: Don Diablo \n\n⬡⬢ Don Diablo ⬢⬡\nSpotify ⬡ http://Spoti.fi/DonDiablo\nMerch ⬡ http://shop.dondiablo.com\nInstagram ⬡ http://instagram.com/dondiablo\nFacebook ⬡ http://facebook.com/OfficialDonDiablo\nTwitter ⬡ http://twitter.com/dondiablo\nYouTube ⬡ http://YouTube.com/DonDiablo?sub_confirmation=1\nSoundCloud ⬡ http://soundcloud.com/dondiablo"

How To Prep Before Grilling The Most Powerful Person On The Internet (HBO),VICE News,25.0,208397.0,1936.0,259.0,595.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gau41b7_Hqs/default.jpg,"Rep. Greg Walden, the chairman of the House committee that grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, told VICE News it may be time for other tech CEOs to come before his committee to outline their own data privacy practices.\n\n“This is not just a Facebook issue,” he said in an interview, noting that other internet companies scrape and sell access to consumers’ data just like Facebook.\n\nWalden, an Oregon Republican, said he’d like to know from companies like Amazon or Google, “what are their protections, what are their user agreements? What should we know about their activities? What can they better regulate themselves, so we don't have to over-regulate here?” \n\nWalden chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Zuckerberg answered five hours worth of questions from members Thursday on everything ranging from its data sharing practices to its efforts to crack down on foreign election medddling. It was the Facebook CEO’s second round of questioning on the Hill, after he testified in front of a Senate panel on Tuesday — part of an apology tour on Capitol Hill meant to reassure lawmakers in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. \n\nWalden — an Oregon Republican whose district is home to three Facebook data centers — has been cautious on enacting new regulations to prevent similar abuses in the past. After Zuckerberg's testimony, Walden said he was still giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt when it came to implementing reforms to its data policies.\n\n“They've got to show the consumer just us the consumer that they understand their problem, they're going to fix it and we're not going to see another apology tour in six months or two years from now,” he said.\n\nIf Facebook fails to do so, Walden added, “there are things in terms of how we can better control our own data I think if they don't fix we can.”\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo"

Auditioning was made easier than ever as hopefuls also had the opportunity to submit audition videos online, as well as via select social media platforms using an official tag, #TheNextIdol, cultivating over 300,000 posts. Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.\n\nHelping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.

WE ARE SOOO CLOSE TO 6M MUFFINS!\n\nNEW videos every Wednesday & Sunday!\n*PLEASE SUBSCRIBE & CLICK THE 🔔 FOR NOTIFICATIONS :)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­-------------------------------------\nHi my loves! Happy Sunday! The long awaited closet tour.... I know you guys have been requesting this for almost 3 years now. I never 100% finished but since I am moving I wanted to give you guys a little preview before I start packing up. It's so crazy that I've been in this house almost 3 years already. I will miss it for sure but I am looking forward to the next chapter in my life!! As I mentioned - although it is super fun having all of these nice things... materialistic things do not define a person. I remember in my first apartment 5 years ago - almost to the day -  looking around at everything I had during a really low point in my life. And I swore I would trade every single item in my closet if it meant someone I loved had another chance at life. (long story.. but in that moment I truly realized how little materialistic things actually meant) Unfortunately we spend a lot of our lives wishing and wanting things we may never get. Take it from me- someone who had nothing, worked 3 jobs and barely had money for bills. Now that I am able to buy a lot of things - as exciting as all of this stuff is.. none of it really matters if you are not happy with who you are. Taking care of yourself physically and emotionally and having healthy relationships with your family and friends always comes first and foremost. With all of that saiddddd I hope you guys enjoy this little peak into my 'woman cave' :D Without all of you none of this would ever be possible. I love you guys SO MUCH!!! XOXO Carli\n\nPS. For those who are confused - I bought this house with the intention on living here forever with my x boyfriend. We broke up almost 8 months ago so I decided to sell the house and buy something closer to my friends and family. My dad is living with me now so I have company in this big house! xo\n----------------------------------------­­­-------------------------------------\n\n*Send me LETTERS!!! \nPO Box 6639\nBridgewater NJ 08807\n\nFollow me on Instagram:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/CarliBel\n\nFollow me on SNAPCHAT!\n@CarliPenguin5\n\nDisclaimer: this video is NOT sponsored.

It's a simple question, though the answer is quite complicated. And it varies tremendously based on what car we're talking about. A $20,000 compact is far more simple than the $155,000 Mercedes S560 Cabriolet driven in this video. With that extra cost comes luxuriousness, the latest technology, and all kinds of features that most drivers will never even know the car has. \n\nOften, complexity is associated with unreliability, and though they may often correlate, that doesn't mean complexity causes unreliability. In the case of luxury cars, it's important to consider who the buyer is. In this video, we'll discuss why it may be a win-win for both manufacturers and consumers to have expensive cars that aren't necessarily reliable. \n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!"

So we melted 603 lipsticks from 20 different brands, and made 500 to send to you all!\n\nDisclaimers:\n1) We washed our hands every time we handled the lipsticks and essentially boiled the lipsticks on the stove as well. \n2) We wore latex gloves and used almond oil when removing the lipsticks from their molds.\n3) Please leave your twitter or insta handle in your comment, so we can contact you!\n4) We can only ship to North American subscribers this time around (since we have so many to ship).\n\nDon’t forget to click the bell to turn on post notifications!\n\nSafiya's Nextbeat: https://nextbeat.co/u/safiya\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajn\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/\n\nAssistant Editor: Emily Linden\n\nMusic\nMind The Gap\nTop Banana\nPeanut Man\nMojo Nation\nWhiskey Attitude\nFunk Diving\nFiesta Brava\nGypsy Sailor\nSharp Dresser\nMesmers Fantasy\nHot Sole\nSpy\nvia Audio Network\n\nSFX\nVia Audioblocks"

Thank you so much for supporting the Real Doctor Reacts to series. I said that if you get the grey's anatomy video to 15k likes I'll do another episode and you CRUSHED it by getting it 200k+ likes. I dove into the comments section to see what medical tv drama you wanted me to review next and it seemed like the good doctor was the obvious choice. Get ready TV Doctors, because Dr. Mike is coming for you =] \n\nFull disclosure, I have never watched an episode of the good doctor on ABC so I decided to go ahead and start my tv medical drama review off with the first episode ( good doctor 1x01 ) of the series. I was really curious myself to see if the good doctor is a medically accurate show.\n\nI really did enjoy this medical tv show because I think it did a lot of things well. It gave an interesting look into what life is like a for a surgeon and a resident. Being a surgical resident is not an easy job and to make the situation even more complex Dr. Sean Murphy has autism so they did a great job of breaking down these circumstances.\n\nI hope you enjoy this episode of Real Doctor Watches The Good Doctor / Real Doctor Reacts to the Good Doctor. If you want me to continue making this series please like the video and leave me a comment on which show or episode you'd like for me to review next.

"G-Force, Jerk, and Passing Out In A Centrifuge",Tom Scott,27.0,367978.0,16137.0,133.0,1246.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMKcO-T5Y4o/default.jpg,"Thanks to the Starrship team for arranging this! I'm also over on their channel, flying with the Blades: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWY3-1gOrxk • At the Royal Air Force training centrifuge in Farnbrough, pilots learn how to avoid G-LOC: g-induced loss of consciousness. Let's talk about g-force, about jerk, and about how to keep circulation flowing to your brain.\n\nFAQs:\n\n* Isn't 3.6g a really low g-tolerance? *\nYep. Turns out I would not qualify to be a fighter pilot. The average range for g-tolerance is 4-6; no-one was expecting me to pass out. The centrifuge team do not deliberately try to G-LOC people! To be fair, though, I'd done a few earlier runs with only minor effects.\n\n* What g was the RAF person at the start pulling? *\nThat's Marcus, from the Starrship team, and he was successfully pulling 6.5g with the help of g-trousers: they plug into a compressed air source in the plane (and in the centrifuge) and act as a lower-body tourniquet to keep the blood up top. They are very effective.\n\n* Why did you shake and shudder when regaining consciousness? *\nThose are called myoclonic convulsions, which is a fancy medical term for muscle jerks, and they're a common side effect of recovering from G-LOC.\n\n* What did it feel like? *\nI'll answer this in more detail in a video over on the Matt and Tom channel soon, but in short: I don't remember it. I was doing the breathing maneuver, then everything was wobbly, then we were stopped!\n\n* Is this a sponsored video? *\nNo: the RAF and Starrship had no editorial control over this, and no money changed hands. Obviously, though, they gave me a spin in the centrifuge, and I'm collaborating with them over on their channel too!\n\n\nTHANKS TO: \nThe RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine, the Starrship team, and the folks at Qinetiq.\n\nSTARRSHIP:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/starrshiphope/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/starrshiphope/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/starrshiphope\n\n\nI'm at http://tomscott.com\non Twitter at http://twitter.com/tomscott\non Facebook at http://facebook.com/tomscott\nand on Snapchat and Instagram as tomscottgo"

It is full coverage and gives your skin the perfect dewy glow that you can then set with powder.\n\nAll you need is 2-3 foundation shades...\nYour first shade should be the lightest foundation that matched the skin at your jawline.\nThe second foundation shade should be 2 to even 4 shades darker than the light shade.\nAnd if you use a third shade like me, it can be a color right in between the darkest foundation and the lightest.\nApply foundation in a dabbing motion to get the most coverage. I like a VERY FULL COVERAGE FOUNDATION, myself! I want my foundation to look like I have perfect doll skin!\nI am going to show you how to apply foundation, the way that I put my foundation on every day.

Isla Nublar now sits abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. \n\nWhen the island’s dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. Owen is driven to find Blue, his lead raptor who’s still missing in the wild, and Claire has grown a respect for these creatures she now makes her mission. Arriving on the unstable island as lava begins raining down, their expedition uncovers a conspiracy that could return our entire planet to a perilous order not seen since prehistoric times.\n\nWith all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful series in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs—along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.

Primitive Technology: Round hut,Primitive Technology,22.0,2783741.0,125003.0,1119.0,10555.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vAuO3bHxSpc/default.jpg,"I built a round hut using palm thatch and mud walls to replace the damaged A-frame hut built a few months ago. The A frame hut was damaged due to torrential rain and poor design elements considering the wet conditions. The thatch had rotted in the part of the roof that gets shade. Moth larvae and mold grew and consumed the thatch in these places. The hut also tilted forward due to the back post being hammered in only 25 cm into the ground. So on returning to the property (it was cut off by flooded bridge) I began work on a new hut.\nThe new hut was positioned further into the open clearing to get more sunlight. A 3 meter diameter circle was scribed and 12 wooden posts were hammered into the ground, each 50 cm deep for a sturdier structure. Lintels were then tied to the top of the posts joining the posts together. A tripod ladder was made from poles lashed together at the top and a platform lashed to its frame. The roof poles were then attached to the top of the lintels and lashed together at the top to form a conical roof frame, 3 meters at the highest point. Loya cane was then tied on the eaves to act as support for the ends of the palm thatch. \n700 palm fronds were then cut split and thatched onto the roof. The tripod ladder was used to climb up and thatch the roof from the inside. A cap was then made to put on the very top of the cone when the roof was almost finished.\nA drainage moat was dug around the hut and the excavated soil was placed on the hut floor to raise its level above the damp ground. A deluge tested the hut’s water shedding abilities. Torrential rain fell while a fire was kept going inside the dry hut. The drainage moat flowed like a stream during the heavy rain event. \nLoya cane was then harvested and woven between the posts. This formed a low wall. It was then daubed with mud inside and out. The clay from this was taken from the drainage moat. Rain falling into the moat meant that water didn’t need to be collected from the stream to mix the mud. This is another benefit of the drainage moat.\nThe low wall allows light and air into the hut. With a fire going in the central pit, mosquitoes are kept at bay. The central fire pit produces smoke and heat that will hopefully prevent moths laying eggs in the roof (the caterpillars of which eat thatch) and will prevent mold from growing. The hut will be used as an undercover work space for future projects.\nWordpress: https://primitivetechnology.wordpress.com\nPatreon page: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2945881\nI have no face book page, instagram, twitter etc. Beware of fake pages."

He was found dead in Muscat, Oman, this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”\n\nAvicii had previously spoken about his health struggles, particularly with his acute pancreatitis diagnosis, which was part of the reason he announced his plans to retire from touring in 2016.  \n\nAs news of his death circulated, hundreds of grief-stricken friends and fans took to social media to share their reactions, including many of his peers from the EDM music world.\n\nCalvin Harris Tweeted QUOTE, “Devastating news about Avicii, a beautiful soul, passionate and extremely talented with so much more to do. My heart goes out to his family. God bless you Tim x”. \n\nCharlie Puth shared his admiration for Avicii with his reaction, writing QUOTE, “Wow, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to the man who really opened my eyes as to what my productions could one day sound like. @Avicii was a genius and a music innovator, and I can not believe he is no longer with us. RIP to the very best”.\n\nLiam Payne also paid respects, Tweeting QUOTE, “Oh my god truly devastated for Avicii  very very sad news way to young...what a talent he was. rest in peace x.”\n\nFellow DJ Marshmello simply wrote QUOTE, “At a loss for words…Rest easy brother @Avicii”, while Zedd shared QUOTE, “No words can describe the sadness I’m feeling right now, hearing about Avicii passing away...Thoughts go out to his family and friends…”\n\nSinger Dua Lipa also expressed her shock and sadness, Tweeting QUOTE, “Such sad news to hear about Avicii passing. Too young and way too soon. My condolences go out to his family, friends and fans x”\n\nBand Imagine Dragons, who previously collaborated with Avicii, Tweeted QUOTE, “devastated at the news of @Avicii passing. working with him was one of my favorite collaborative moments. far too young. the world was a happier and fuller place with his presence and art. sending all my love to his friends and family. Xxdr”\n\nWe here at Clevver also want to express our sincerest condolences to Tim’s family, friends and fans.

"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot - Official Trailer | Amazon Studios",Amazon Studios,1.0,982751.0,345.0,42.0,16.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2BwxeOzSx8A/default.jpg,"The last day Portland slacker John Callahan is able to walk, he wakes up without a hangover — because he’s still drunk from the night before. That night at a wild party he meets a wisecracking drinking buddy (Jack Black), who insists they leave for an even better party he knows about. But when his new friend dozes off at the wheel, John wakes up confined to a wheelchair with only partial use of his arms. Though he initially has no intention of getting sober, he reluctantly attends a 12-step meeting run by a charismatic and dedicated sponsor named Donnie (Jonah Hill) and reconnects with Annu (Rooney Mara), a therapist he met at the hospital. With their encouragement, John finds that love is not beyond his reach and discovers a hidden talent for drawing, channeling his playful personality into crude, politically incorrect — and often hilarious — cartoons, which develop a national following. Based on a true story, this poignant, insightful, funny drama about redemption, forgiveness and the healing power of art is adapted from Callahan’s autobiography and directed by two-time Oscar® nominee Gus Van Sant (Milk, Good Will Hunting). The film stars Oscar® nominees Joaquin Phoenix (Her, Walk the Line), Jonah Hill (The Wolf of Wall Street, Moneyball) and Rooney Mara (Carol, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), as well as Jack Black (Bernie, School of Rock), Carrie Brownstein (“Portlandia,” “Transparent”), Beth Ditto and Kim Gordon.\n\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosSubscribe\n» In select theaters July 13.\n\nAbout Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot:\nOn the rocky path to sobriety after a life-changing accident, John Callahan discovers the healing power of art, willing his injured hands into drawing edgy, hilarious, often controversial cartoons, which bring him a national following and a new lease on life.\n\nGet More from Amazon Studios: \nOfficial site: http://bit.ly/GetMoreAmazonStudios\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosTwitter\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/AmazonStudiosInstagram\n\nAbout Amazon Studios:\nThe goal of Amazon Studios is to turn original stories into great entertainment.\n\nDon't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot - Official Trailer | Amazon Studios\nhttps://youtu.be/2BwxeOzSx8A\n\nAmazon Studios\nhttps://www.youtube.com/AmazonStudios"

Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end.

Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.Q. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.Q. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?A. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from our online shop! - https://shop.simonscat.com/"

Also, for the first time in “American Idol” history, hopefuls had the opportunity to audition through a livestream platform.Helping to determine who America will ultimately vote for to become the next singing sensation, are music industry forces and superstar judges, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie.

Willink, former Navy SEAL and author of Way of the Warrior Kid explains the one habit from service that he can't shake.For the full interview, search for Success!

So for example, you still wake up at 4:30 in the morning, to go workout, what was it about your time in the Seals, that you wanted to keep these habits up?Jocko Willink: They're good habits, why would you not wake up at 4:30?Richard Feloni: Well what does this bring to you?Jocko Willink: Waking up early? You just get a jump on the day. The reason I wake up at 4:30 in the morning is because no one else is awake yet, so that gives me the opportunity to do things that I need to get done, kinda selfishly for myself, and the big one in that category is working out. And it doesn't feel good at 4:30 when you get up, but by the time 7 o'clock rolls around, and you've already worked out, and you've already got some work done, and you've got some time to say goodbye to your kids before they go to school? It's infinitely better than sleeping in until 6:45, and you get out of bed, and now you've missed your kids going to school, or whatever. You're not prepared for the day, it's awful.Feloni: So if someone, maybe they don't have time to work out or they just need something that could be like a quick fix, is there something that you recommend?Willink: Oh yeah, workouts don't have to take a long time. Workouts can be very quick. Matter of fact, go do two minutes of burpees, as many burpees as you can, in two minutes, or four minutes, or six minutes, go and sprint, go and do anything very intensely, for a short period of time and you'll get great benefit out of it.Feloni: Something I'm sure you hear a lot is 4:30, like this either just can't fit into my schedule, or if I'm gonna be realistic, I'm probably not gonna wake up at 4:30, what do you tell people who say that?Willink: Yeah, and there's people that work night shifts, and there's people that it's unhealthy for them, they can't fall as-- it's like no, be healthy, get enough sleep, but, first of all, wake up at the same time every day and, if you pick that time and you start waking up at the same time every day, that's very good for you. It doesn't have to be 4:30, it could be 6:30, it could be 7, I don't know what your personal schedule is, but find out a time, pick it, set it, stick to it, and maintain that schedule, and that's gonna end up better for you.I recommend it's earlier. I recommend that you go to bed earlier, 'cause what are you doing at night, most of the time? Most of the time at night, you're not working on anything super productive, you're just winding down and watching stupid YouTube videos, or surfing the internet, reading clickbait stories, right? Don't do that, instead, go to sleep, and then wake up early.Feloni: Could you explain that notion of discipline equals freedom?Willink: If you want more freedom in your life, you have to have more discipline. If you don't have any discipline, you'll end up with absolutely no freedom, you'll end up being a slave to other people that boss you around. There's all kind of problems that can occur, if you don't have discipline in your life. And the more discipline you have, the more freedom you're gonna have.Feloni: So just the discipline of the Seals, will never-- it's impossible to leave?Willink: No, it's possible to leave, there's retired seals all over the place that are undisciplined. They've moved on, and they don't care about that anymore. It's fine, I don't judge other people on what they're doin', like they're probably stoked to sleep in and hang out with their kids, and eat breakfast in bed, that's fine. I don't have anything against that. But for me? I wanna get up and go."

It’s the early 1970s, and Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) is the first African-American detective to serve in the Colorado Springs Police Department. Determined to make a name for himself, Stallworth bravely sets out on a dangerous mission: infiltrate and expose the Ku Klux Klan. The young detective soon recruits a more seasoned colleague, Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver), into the undercover investigation of a lifetime. Together, they team up to take down the extremist hate group as the organization aims to sanitize its violent rhetoric to appeal to the mainstream.  Produced by the team behind the Academy-Award® winning Get Out."

Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?A. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects."

Wildlife - Official Teaser I HD I IFC Films,IFC Films,1.0,863758.0,1594.0,38.0,98.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WemDKlmMAIs/default.jpg,"Directed by: Paul DanoStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Carey Mulligan, Bill Camp, Ex Oxenbould & Zoe Margaret CollettiOpening in theaters October 19thIFC Films presents WILDLIFE, the directorial debut of Paul Dano (THERE WILL BE BLOOD, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE), co-written along with Zoe Kazan (THE BIG SICK). Elegantly adapted from Richard Ford’s novel of the same name, Carey Mulligan (MUDBOUND, AN EDUCATION) delivers one of her finest performances to date as Jeanette, a complex woman whose self-determination and self-involvement disrupts the values and expectations of a 1960s nuclear family. Fourteen-year-old Joe played by newcomer Ed Oxenbould, is the only child of Jeanette (Mulligan) and Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal)—a housewife and a golf pro—in a small town in 1960s Montana. Nearby, an uncontrolled forest fire rages close to the Canadian border, and when Jerry loses his job—and his sense of purpose—he decides to join the cause of fighting the fire, leaving his wife and son to fend for themselves. Suddenly forced into the role of an adult, Joe witnesses his mother's struggle as she tries to keep her head above water. With precise details and textures of its specific time and place, WILDLIFE commits to the viewpoint of a teenage boy observing the gradual dissolution of his parents’ marriage. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and will also screened as the opening night film in La Semaine de la Critique at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. WILDLIFE will be released by IFC Films on October 19, 2018.CAST Carey Mulligan, Ed Oxenbould, Bill Camp, and Jake GyllenhaalDIRECTED BY Paul DanoWRITTEN BY Zoe Kazan and Paul DanoPRODUCERS Alex Saks, Paul Dano, Oren Moverman, Ann Ruark, Jake Gyllenhaal, Riva MakerIFC PR CONTACT Laura Sok | teampr@ifcfilms.comRUN TIME 104 minutesDISTRIBUTOR IFC Films#IFCFilms #WildlifeSubscribe to IFC: http://youtube.com/user/IFCFilmsTubeConnect with IFC OnlineIFC Films Official Site: http://www.ifcfilms.comFollow IFC Films on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IFCFilmsFind IFC Films on Facebook: http://facebook.com/IFCFilmsOfficialFollow IFC Films on Instagram : http://instagram.com/ifcfilms"

This pool challenge was crazy as we filled my pool with 1,000 POOL floaties. We grabbed as many pool toys and pool floats as we could fin and dumped them in my pool. We played different pool games like floor is lava challenge and hide and seek in the pool. We even had the idea to maybe make a box fort or flute fort out of all these pool toys and try to survive in it for 24 hours just like in one of our 24 hour box fort challenges. Maybe in the next funny video we will take it a step farther and fill my pool with orbeez or water beads!   Giant balloon what happens if you orbeez into a balloon in a pool party? Say what comedy.

Learning about my ancestry and discovering some of my taste preferences, and comparing them with my Dad, was fascinating. He and I both had a great time meeting and eating. We happen to be traveling in Ghana, and my Dad happened to be in Nairobi, Kenya for a few days having some meetings, so I thought it would be a perfect opportunity, to meet my Dad. Luckily it all worked out smoothly!Accra, GhanaWaakye - 8 GHC ($1.80) - Waakye is a popular Ghanaian food / meal, and that’s what we started the day with. You get rice and beans, a number of other starches, and some tomato sauce stew and meats, all piled high into a leaf bowl. It was delicious!Makola Market - Next we visited Makola Market, the largest and most energetic market in Accra. It’s a must visit, to see the energy and life at the market.The Accra Arts Center - Finally, we stopped off at the Accra Arts Center to buy a few things before leaving in at night.Accra to Nairobi - We had a late night flight, and we landed early at sunrise to cool Nairobi!After checking into a hotel just for 1 night, we took a quick hour nap, and then jumped into a taxi to go meet my Dad who was staying at a guesthouse.It was great to see my Dad and at the guesthouse we compared our ancestry and our taste preference. Then we went to go eat some Kenyan food, which was a highlight. Now do you know where I got my love for food from?Java House coffee - Finally, as you already know, I have a tendency to enjoy caffeine, and so does my Dad. So it was only right to stop for a cup of coffee to finish.Thank you for watching, and again, a big thank you to https://www.23andme.com/markwiens for sponsoring this video.MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Check out: https://www.23andme.com/markwiens"
